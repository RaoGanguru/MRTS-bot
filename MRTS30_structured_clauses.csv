MRTS30,1.1,Overview,6,7,"This Technical Specification sets out the requirements for asphalt used in road pavements and
includes the following asphalt types:
• Medium duty dense graded asphalt (AC7M, AC10M, AC14M and AC20M)
• Heavy duty dense graded asphalt (AC7H, AC10H, AC14H and AC20H)
• Open graded asphalt (OG10 and OG14), and
• Stone mastic asphalt (SMA10 and SMA14).
More sustainable asphalt and lower emissions
This Technical Specification requires asphalt mixes to contain a warm mix asphalt additive to
enable these mixes to be produced at a lower temperature than has historically been required (in
previous versions of this Technical specification). This temperature reduction should help lower
emissions and improve sustainability outcomes while still achieving a conforming product.
The term “dense graded asphalt” is used throughout this Technical Specification to refer to both
medium duty and heavy duty dense graded asphalt and may contain Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement
(RAP) material.
Guidance1 on the selection of binder grade for use in dense graded asphalt is provided in the table
below.

MRTS30,1,This table has been developed to assist designers in selecting binders to optimise performance outcomes,7,7,"on projects. Mixes may be used outside these parameters and still provide acceptable long-term
performance."
MRTS30,2,"High shear areas include signalised intersections and approaches, roundabouts and approaches, and",7,7,"other areas with very slow moving heavy vehicles. For bus stops, busways and bus-only lanes, specialist
advice should be sought from the Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings)."
MRTS30,3,M1000 typically has a shorter oxidation life than C320 and A15E binders. More frequent resurfacing,7,7,should be anticipated where M1000 binder is used in surfacing layers.
MRTS30,4,A15E binder is typically used in situations where enhanced deformation and/or fatigue resistance is,7,8,"desired.
This Technical Specification shall be read in conjunction with MRTS01 Introduction to Technical
Specifications, MRTS50 Specific Quality System Requirements and other Technical Specifications as
appropriate.
This Technical Specification forms part of the Transport and Main Roads Specifications Manual.
For projects that utilise this Technical Specification, the following personnel should have completed
and have a certificate of attainment for the Australian flexible Pavements Association (AfPA) course
“ASA407A Administration of Specifications - MRTS30 Asphalt Pavements”:
• Contractor’s and Prequalified Asphalt Contractor’s (PAC) Project Manager(s), Engineer(s)
and Site Supervisor(s) for the asphalt works
• Administrator, and Inspector.
The Administrator should implement an audit and surveillance plan. Typically, a minimum of 10% of
asphalt lots should be audited on the department’s projects. An increased or reduced frequency
may apply based on the PAC’s historical performance and the project’s risk profile.
This Technical Specification is based on the principles outlined in Austroads Guide to Pavement
Technology Part 4B: Asphalt. The Austroads Guide should be used by PACs and Administrators, in
conjunction with the material from the above mentioned AfPA course and Austroads Pavement
Work Tips, as the first point of reference.
Administrators can seek further advice on interpretation of this Technical Specification from the
Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings)."
MRTS30,1.2,Performance requirements,8,8,"The asphalt must not ravel, rut, shove, strip or bleed for the first 24 months after the Date of Practical
Completion, and the surface of the asphalt must comply with the surface shape requirements specified
in Table 9.5.2 for the first 12 months after the Date of Practical Completion.
The requirements of Clause 1.2 are based on the assumption that the asphalt works will be
completed shortly before the date of practical completion. Adjustment to these requirements may
be required for other scenarios."
MRTS30,2,Definitions of terms,8,8,"The terms used in this Technical Specification are defined in Clause 2 of MRTS01 Introduction to
Table 2 – Definition of terms

• asphalt placed during a single work shift, and
• multiple layers of asphalt provided that the minimum testing frequencies are observed, and the
tonnage of asphalt in each layer and the conformance of each layer are recorded separately.
Multiple layers may be placed in a single lot, however in this instance it would generally be
considered that inherent variance in the placement process would support classification of each
layer as a sub-lot for conformance purposes.
The minimum number of tests shall be applied at the minimum testing frequency given in
Table 5.4.1(d).
To achieve the requirements for air voids and layer thickness measurement, the Contractor may
elect to deep core the full thickness of asphalt placed in the lot at the completion of the final layer of

satisfaction of the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar that the inclusion of RAP will not adversely affect the
performance characteristics of the asphalt. The Contractor shall support any such application with
appropriate test data. RAP may be used in PMB mixes in all other situations.
Where the pavement design is reliant on the enhanced fatigue performance of the polymer
modified binder, this Technical Specification does not allow RAP to be included in these mixes
unless the Contractor can demonstrate the performance characteristics of the asphalt mix have not
been adversely affected by the inclusion of RAP. Fatigue and resilient modulus testing of the mix,

For dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt, air voids in laboratory compacted specimens

that influence the performance of the asphalt include:
• the magnitude of the nonconformance
• traffic loading
• depth of the layer from the pavement surface, and
• the binder used in the asphalt mix.
For dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt, air voids in laboratory compacted specimens
above the maximum limit may lead to the maximum value for insitu air voids not being achieved
and the mix being prone to oxidation and moisture related damage over time. Mix with air voids in
laboratory compacted specimens above the maximum limit is typically accepted subject to
compliance with the insitu air voids requirements.
The workability of stone mastic asphalt mixes at placement temperatures reduces as the fixed

Pavements shall be included as part of the mix design submission.
It is recommended that mix design(s) are submitted to the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar for
registration not less than 28 days prior to asphalt being incorporated into the Works. This will allow
sufficient time for review and resubmission of the mix design (if required) without the Works being
delayed."
MRTS30,7.3.3,Nomination of registered mix designs,35,36,"At least seven days before asphalt is to be incorporated into the Works, the Contractor shall submit to
the Administrator a copy of the mix design certificate(s) for each nominal size and type of asphalt mix
to be incorporated into the Works. Milestone The asphalt mix design(s) must be listed on the
department’s asphalt mix design register. Only asphalt complying with the nominated mix design(s)
shall be incorporated into the Works. Where more than one mix design certificate is submitted to the
Administrator for a nominal size and type of asphalt, the Contractor shall nominate one ‘primary’ mix
design to be incorporated into the Works. Nominated mix designs, other than the ‘primary’ mix design,
may only be incorporated into the Works with the prior approval of the Administrator. The Contractor
may use a different mix design as the ‘primary’ mix design (provided it is selected from the list of
nominated mix designs) at any time during the Works provided the Contractor advises the
Administrator in writing at least 24 hours prior to the implementation of this change.
At any time during the Works, the Contractor may submit a revision to a nominated mix design to
ensure ongoing compliance with specification requirements. Prior to the revised mix design being
incorporated into the Works, the Contractor must:
a) submit a certified copy of an updated mix design certificate (and supporting documentation)
for the revised mix design to the Administrator and Asphalt Mix Design Registrar, and
b) allow not less than three working days for the Administrator to consider the Contractor’s
submission.
A heavy duty dense graded asphalt mix design may be used where medium duty dense graded
asphalt is specified for the Works.
The Department of Transport and Main Roads maintains an asphalt mix design register on the
Transport and Main Roads website. Administrators can check the currency of an asphalt mix
design certificate using this register. For recently submitted mix designs, the Administrator should
check their registration status with the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar.
For the purposes of this clause, a mix design revision only relates to a minor change in grading,
binder content, maximum density and constituent proportions. A change to the mix design
constituents constitutes a new mix design. The Administrator may seek advice from the Asphalt Mix
Design Registrar when assessing the suitability of a revised mix design.
Test reports for properties that are not for conformance (i.e., test results are ‘report only’) do not
need to be included in a revised mix design submission."
MRTS30,7.4.1,General,36,37,"Asphalt shall be produced by a registered asphalt manufacturer from the nominated asphalt plant in
accordance with the nominated mix design for the Works. Asphalt shall not be incorporated into the
Works until the Contractor has demonstrated to the Administrator that the underlying lots conform to
the specified requirements or have been accepted by the Administrator for utilisation at a reduced
level of service, and the following documents have been received and reviewed by the Administrator.
Hold Point 2:
a) identity of the PAC(s) who will undertake the asphalt production, placement and compaction
and the address of the asphalt plant that will produce the asphalt (refer Clause 6)
b) the mix design certificate, which holds current registration with Transport and Main Roads, for
each conforming mix design to be used in the Works (refer Clause 7.3) or conforming revised
mix design submissions (where applicable) (refer Clause 7.3.3)
c) the Contractor’s AQP (refer Clause 5.2)
d) the Contractor’s Aggregate Production Procedure (refer MRTS101 Aggregates for Asphalt),
and
e) the Contractor’s RAP Management Plan (where applicable).
These documents shall be submitted to the Administrator not less than seven days prior to the
commencement of asphalt being incorporated into the Works.
Any subsequent changes to any of the above documents will require re-submission and re-release of
the Hold Point.
The requirements of this Technical Specification represent the minimum standards that generally
apply to asphalt incorporated into the department’s projects. However, in some regional localities,
the use of asphalt fully conforming with the requirements of this Technical Specification may be
prohibitively expensive, particularly if conforming constituent materials are not locally available.
There may also be situations where the department wishes to trial the use of nonstandard
constituent materials in asphalt mixes that are innovative in nature and their use aligns with other
strategic objectives of the department (such as increasing the use of recycled materials).
The need for project specific variations to enable the use of constituent materials that are
nonstandard or that do not conform with the default requirements should be endorsed by the
Principal during the preconstruction phase of the project and the requirements nominated in the
Contract to enable competitive tendering for the Works.
Given that these mix designs contain nonconforming or nonstandard materials, they may be
registered, at the discretion of the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar, as nonconforming or nonstandard
mix designs. However, the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar may require additional testing to be
carried out prior to registration being granted. ‘Conditions of use’ associated with the
implementation and use of these mix designs on Transport and Main Roads projects may also be
nominated on the Asphalt Mix Design Register.
An engineering risk assessment should be undertaken during the preconstruction phase of a
project to evaluate whether a departure from the default requirements or the use of nonstandard
constituent materials is appropriate. The designer for the Works is advised to seek advice from the
Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings) when undertaking these assessments. These
assessments should consider as a minimum, the following:
• the estimated cost savings or additional costs of the departure
• potential performance impacts, including those on road users, serviceability, durability and
overall functionality
• whole-of-life performance including maintenance requirements
• construction programme impacts
• safety and environmental impacts, and
• additional monitoring that will occur post construction.
Hold Point 3 provides a mechanism for acceptance of a nonconforming or nonstandard mix
designs that do not conform to the default constituent materials’ specifications but conform to
project specific requirements listed in the Contract to be accepted on a project specific basis. The
Administrator may seek advice from the Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings) when
undertaking these assessments as well as the interpretation of any ‘conditions of use’ nominated
on the Asphalt Mix Design Register for a particular mix design.
Nonconforming or nonstandard mix designs that hold current registration with the department shall not
be incorporated into the Works unless otherwise accepted in writing by the Administrator prior to the
commencement of asphalt production. Hold Point 3"

A documented procedure for the management and control of the moisture content of each constituent
aggregate material, including RAP material, shall be implemented and the asphalt manufacturing
process controls adjusted accordingly.
RAP materials where added must be dispersed uniformly throughout the mix such that there is no
apparent variability or temperature segregation in the mix.

For each load of asphalt, the Contractor must record the time of manufacture, dispatch from the
manufacturing plant and incorporation into the Works.
Storing asphalt at elevated temperatures may lead to excessive degradation of the binder and a
reduced service life for the asphalt. This Technical Specification provides for overnight storage of
hot dense graded asphalt if unexpected events (such as wet weather or traffic management issues
on the job site) mean that all the asphalt produced during a day’s production cannot be
incorporated into the Works during that work shift. Provided the asphalt is stored in such a way that
minimises oxidation, does not cool excessively and maintains temperature uniformity, it may be
incorporated into the Works on the following day. Some plants may be able to achieve longer

Note:"
MRTS30,1,Unless otherwise stated on the Asphalt Mix Design Certificate.,40,41,"More sustainable asphalt and lower emissions
This Technical Specification requires asphalt mixes to contain a warm mix asphalt additive to enable
these mixes to be produced and compacted at a lower temperature than has historically been required
(in previous versions of this Technical Specification). This temperature reduction should help lower
emissions and improve sustainability outcomes while still achieving a conforming product.
Implementation of these new requirements will require adjustment to manufacturing, transport and
construction processes when compared to hot mix asphalt. However, there may be cases where
conformance with the insitu air voids requirements could be difficult to achieve due to the lower
maximum production temperature limits. These situations would typically be associated with placing
asphalt during cold weather (e.g., when the air temperature or pavement surface temperature is less
than 20°C for 7 mm mixes, 15°C for 10 mm mixes, 10°C for 14 mm mixes and 5°C for 20 mm mixes),
or when the work involves long haul distances to site (e.g., haul time between the asphalt plant and a
remote job site exceeds 3 hours). If construction needs to proceed in these situations, the
Administrator may approve an increase to the maximum production temperature (to 175°C for mixes
containing a bitumen binder and 185°C for mixes containing a polymer modified binder) to help reduce
the risk of nonconforming (that is, high) insitu air voids. Preferably such decisions and the process for
making them would be discussed and confirmed at a contract pre-start meeting (that includes the
prequalified asphalt contractor) or a contract meeting (that includes the prequalified asphalt contractor)
held well in advance of the asphalt works starting.
Prior to approving this type of relaxation, Administrators should seek advice from
asphaltmixdesign@tmr.qld.gov.au."

otherwise approved by the Administrator. Testing for perceptible surface deformation is exempt from
the requirement for NATA accreditation or Construction Materials Testing (CMT) registration.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, asphalt shall not be placed over pavement exhibiting
significant perceptible surface deformation. Hold Point 4
Where the contract requires the Contractor to place the first layer of asphalt directly over a

Administrator will typically direct:
• additional pavement preparation / strengthening work to be undertaken prior to placement
of asphalt, or
• placement of asphalt over the weak substrate. Areas of asphalt placed directly over
substrate exhibiting significant perceptible surface deformation under load are typically
excluded from the lot when determining the characteristic value of insitu air voids (refer

Strain alleviating fabric strips shall be non-woven polyester fabric strips precoated with a rubberised
bitumen adhesive base.
Prior to application of the fabric strips, the existing surface shall be swept clean so that it is free of
dust, grit, surface moisture and vegetation. Any cracks or joints wider than 2 mm shall be filled as
detailed in Clause 8.2.3.
The surface to which the strain alleviating fabric strip is to be applied shall be sprayed with a
bituminous emulsion tack coat or proprietary primer. The fabric strips shall be laid to cover a minimum
width of 250 mm (normally 125 mm on each side of the crack).
Placement of the strain alleviating fabric strip shall be carried out only under the following conditions:

temperatures nominated in Table 8.7 in situations where the Contractor can demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Administrator that their construction process ensures a strong bond is formed
between the new asphalt and the underlying pavement, and the specified level of compaction is
achieved for the compacted asphalt with low variation in insitu air voids. These objectives are
typically demonstrated by:
• extracting cores from the pavement to show that a strong bond has been achieved
• for dense graded asphalt (with a nominated layer thickness > 30 mm) and stone mastic
asphalt, testing for insitu air voids to show the air voids in the compacted asphalt is
conforming with low variation, and
• for dense graded asphalt (with a nominated layer thickness ≤ 30 mm) and open graded
asphalt, measuring the asphalt temperature at the commencement of rolling to show the
requirement of Table 8.8 has been achieved.
Acceptance to pave asphalt at temperatures below the minimum values stated in Table 8.7, does
not discharge the Contractor’s responsibilities under Clause 1.2."
MRTS30,8.8,Paving and compaction temperatures,47,48,"The Contractor’s AQP must document the temperatures at which the asphalt is placed and compacted
to achieve the insitu air voids requirements specified in Clause 9.2.1. The Contractor shall nominate
the following requirements in the AQP:
a) the minimum temperature at which asphalt is to be delivered to the pavement
b) the minimum temperature at which initial compaction of the asphalt is to commence, and
c) the method of temperature measurement (e.g., internal probe, infrared surface thermometer
etc.).
The Contractor must not incorporate asphalt in the Works that exhibits a temperature variation unless
it has been remixed to a consistent and adequate temperature for compaction.
At the commencement of rolling, the temperature of open graded asphalt shall not be less than that
stated in Table 8.8.
Table 8.8 – Minimum temperature at commencement of rolling for dense graded asphalt with a
nominated thickness ≤ 30 mm and open graded asphalt
Asphalt Mix Type Minimum Mix Temperature (ºC)
Dense graded asphalt 115
Open graded asphalt 120
For open graded asphalt, the Contractor’s compaction procedure shall include not less than
five passes of the steel-wheeled roller within 20 minutes of discharge of the asphalt into the paver
receiving hopper. Rollers used to compact open graded asphalt shall have a minimum static weight of
six tonnes.
For dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt, each asphalt mix design has its own optimal
temperature range for compaction and therefore specific temperature limits are not stated in this
is to achieve an asphalt layer that is relatively uniform in thickness and density. Achieving a
relatively uniform density requires the asphalt to be placed and compacted at relatively uniform
temperatures. Intermittent supply of asphalt to the paver is a common cause for stop / start paving
and significant temperature variation at the commencement of rolling. Such variations should be
avoided wherever possible, as they often lead to variation in density (air voids) and premature
distress. Areas may be sub-lotted and tested separately to confirm they comply with the
specification requirements for air voids.
AP-PWT13 - Temperature Characteristics of Binders in Asphalt provides guidance on minimum
temperatures for effective compaction of asphalt mixes.
For open graded asphalt and dense graded asphalt with a nominal layer thickness ≤ 30 mm, insitu
air voids is not typically tested. For this reason, a minimum temperature at the commencement of
rolling is specified.
The temperatures referenced in Table 8.8 are the internal temperatures of the paved layer.
The Contractor shall measure, monitor, and record paving and compaction temperatures as described
in the AQP with a hand held or machine mounted infrared thermometer or other suitable temperature
measuring device at the discharge point from a tipper truck or at the distribution auger on the paver."
MRTS30,8.9,Tack coat,48,49,"Prior to applying the tack coat, the existing surface must be clean, dry and free from loose and other
deleterious material.
The Contractor shall nominate in the AQP the bituminous emulsion grade and proposed tack coat
application rate(s). The Contractor shall advise the Administrator in writing of any change to the
nominated application rate due to site conditions prior to applying the tack coat. The tack coat shall be:
a) evenly applied to the pavement surface at a rate that achieves a strong bond between
pavement layers (i.e., 0.10 to 0.30 L/m² residual binder at 15ºC), and
b) allowed to break and be dry to touch prior to laying asphalt.
The nominated application rate for joints and chases shall be doubled.
Tack coat is not required where asphalt is placed directly over an asphalt or sprayed bituminous
treatment (i.e., spayed seal) that:
a) has been placed on the same day or previous day as the asphalt that will be placed
b) has not been subjected to traffic, and
c) has a clean appearance.
It is the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure that the tack coat type and application rate achieve a
strong bond to the underlying pavement and between asphalt layers. AP-PWT51 - Asphalt Tack
Coating provides guidance on asphalt tack coating.
The time lapse between applying the tack coat and laying the subsequent asphalt layer will vary
depending on the climatic conditions and the grade of bituminous emulsion being used.
Application rates towards the low end of the specified range (0.10 to 0.30 L/m²) should be adopted
when placing asphalt over relatively new asphalt layers. Application rates that are towards the
higher end of this range should be used when placing asphalt over oxidised and/or milled surfaces.
Asphalt layers may be lightly trafficked for construction purposes without the need for tack coating.
This would typically be limited to trafficking with the paving train and associated equipment such as
traffic control and other service vehicles provided the asphalt surface remains free of any material
or contamination that may compromise bonding to the underlying layer. Asphalt layers that are
open to general traffic or used for broader construction access would typically require tack coating.
A sprayed bituminous surfacing (instead of a tack coat) is typically placed immediately below open
graded asphalt to waterproof the underlying pavement.
The Contractor shall provide an endorsed daily record to the Administrator of the average tack coat
application rate applied to each lot. The tack coat application rate shall be reported in terms of residual
bitumen and the percentage dilution of the tack coat used during spraying shall be stated.
Tack coat shall be applied by spray bar fitted to a mechanical sprayer. Hand spraying shall be carried
out only in those areas where it is impractical to use a mechanical sprayer. Precautions shall be taken
to protect kerbs, channels, adjoining structures, traffic and parked vehicles from tack coat spray.
The tack coat must be intact at the commencement of asphalt placement.
The tack coated surface shall not be opened to public traffic."
MRTS30,8.10,Joints,49,49,"The Contractor shall describe in the AQP the procedure for the construction of asphalt joints. The
Contractor’s procedure must maximise joint density and include mechanised edge compaction or
mechanised edge trimming. Hand tamping of edges is permitted only where the use of a machine is
impractical. Excess material resulting from hand preparation of edges must not be spread on the
surface of the Works.
All loose, cracked and/or bony material at the edge of a paved run must be removed prior to placing
the adjacent run. Asphalt resulting from the clean-up and trimming of joints shall be discarded and
shall not be incorporated into the Works.
Each joint must be finished with a smooth, planar surface aligning with the surface of the rest of the
layer and satisfying the surface shape requirements specified in Clause 9.6.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, longitudinal joints must be:
a) offset by 150 mm from the joint in the underlying layers, except for longitudinal joints on a
crowned pavement
b) within 150 mm of the line of change in crossfall
c) located away from trafficked wheel paths, and
d) for the final surfacing layer, coinciding with the final traffic lane markings.
The Administrator may approve pavement joints to be constructed away from lane marking where
this represents the best outcome to achieve the pavement design intent. For example, when paving
a single lane ramp with asphalt shoulders, the Administrator may allow the Contractor to form a
single longitudinal joint along the centre of the ramp rather than paving the ramp lane between the
edge line marking and subsequently paving narrow shoulders on either side.
In certain circumstances it may be necessary for joints in underlying pavement layers to not be
offset where geometric design requirements apply, e.g., when paving in a mill and fill situation or
where minimum paving widths apply.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, transverse joints must be:
a) located a minimum of 25 m apart
b) offset by a minimum of 1 m from the joint in the underlying layer or as shown on the Drawings
c) formed at the commencement of each paving run, and
d) formed when a delay in paving causes asphalt temperature to fall below the initial compaction
temperature nominated in Clause 8.8."
MRTS30,8.11,Placement trial,50,50,"If specified in Clause 6 of Annexure MRTS30.1 and prior to commencing work, the plant and
personnel proposed for use for the Works must be subjected to a placement trial.
Each nominated mix must be subjected to a separate placement trial. Each placement trial may be
located within the Works. The size of each placement trial must be limited to one lot. The Contractor
must design the trial to implement all the procedures described in the AQP and demonstrate
conformance with this Technical Specification, including:
a) homogeneity
b) insitu air voids
c) course thickness
d) course position
e) surface shape, and
f) joint quality.
The Contractor shall submit a copy of the completed inspection and test plan and all relevant test
results and records from the placement trial. Prior to further placement of the Contractor’s nominated
mix(s) in the Works, the Administrator shall review the outcomes of the placement trial. No further
work shall be undertaken until the Administrator has given approval to proceed. Hold Point 7
In the event of a nonconformance in the placement trial, or when the Administrator determines that a
previous trial is not representative of the materials, asphalt mix proportions, temperature, plant, rate of
output and/or method of placement, a new trial must be undertaken and the Hold Point re-released,
prior to full-scale placement resuming.
Where a placement trial forms part of the Works, all nonconformances in respect of materials, process
and finished pavement properties shall be managed in accordance with Clause 5.
For open graded asphalt, the trial shall also determine the assigned compacted density of the asphalt
mix. The assigned compacted density of the asphalt layer shall be determined using the following
formula:
D = 1000 x M / (Tc x A)
where:
D = the assigned compacted density of an open graded asphalt mix, in tonnes per cubic
metre.
Tc = average thickness of cores extracted from the pavement lot, in millimetres
M = the mass of asphalt in the pavement lot, in tonnes
A = area of the pavement lot, in square metres.
A minimum of five cores shall be taken from the lot to determine the average bulk density (determined
in accordance with AS/NZS 2891.9.3) and thickness of the layer."
MRTS30,8.12.1,General,51,51,"Temporary ramps that are constructed for the safe trafficking of the Works must be constructed by
placement of asphalt complying with this Technical Specification as appropriate for the application, or
by cold milling of existing or new asphalt.
The dimensions of ramps shall be determined by the Contractor to suit the situation and be of a
standard not less than that stated in Clauses 8.12.2 to 8.12.4."

particles having a grading complying with the requirements shown in Table 8.13, or other material as
approved by the Administrator. The grit shall be dry, clean, hard, angular, durable, and free from clay
and other aggregations of fine material, soil, organic matter and any other deleterious material.

MRTS30,0.075,0 – 1.0,51,52,"The grit shall be uniformly spread and rolled into the surface of the hot asphalt during the compaction
process. The temperature at which the grit material is applied shall be such that the grit forms a strong
bond with, and is partially coated by, the binder in the asphalt mix. The spread rate to be adopted for
grit material shall be nominated by the Contractor and be applied at a rate ≥ 0.3 kg/m² for SMA14 and
≥ 0.2 kg/m² for SMA10. After consultation with the Administrator, the nominated spread rate may be
adjusted to ensure an adequate coverage of grit is achieved.
Prior to the pavement section being opened to traffic, any loose grit material shall be removed from
the road surface."
MRTS30,9.1,Homogeneity,52,52,"All asphalt must be homogeneous in appearance.
Areas of asphalt that exhibit cracking, ravelling, bony or fatty material, or have been damaged during
construction must be rectified or replaced.
Any proposal by the Contractor that the Administrator accept non-homogeneous and/or segregated
material or work must be in writing and must show:
a) the technical reasons for acceptance
b) justification that the non-homogeneous section complies with this Technical Specification, and
c) sub-lotting that minimises performance risk to the surface and structure of the pavement."
MRTS30,9.2.1,Requirements for insitu air voids,52,52,"Dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt must have a dense appearance. Each layer of asphalt

MRTS30,1,"Where testing is ordered by the Administrator, only asphalt constructed as part of the Works shall be tested",53,53,"(including asphalt abutting existing pavement or other infrastructure).
For dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt, insitu air voids below the minimum value may
lead to rutting, flushing, bleeding and/or mix instability. Factors that influence the performance of
the asphalt include traffic loading, depth of the layer from the pavement surface and the binder
used in the asphalt mix.
Insitu air voids above the maximum value may lead to accelerated hardening of the binder (through
oxidation), ravelling, ingress of moisture and/or stripping of the asphalt layer.
Pavement joints are typically accepted as areas with insitu air voids greater than the maximum
value for the mat. Therefore, a higher maximum limit for insitu air voids applies to joints. However,
joints are not usually tested for insitu air voids unless the Administrator suspects, based on
surveillance and/or the visual appearance of the joints, the specified requirements have not been
achieved. Typically, joint compaction would be tested across joints where both adjoining sections of
asphalt have been placed under the same contract, or within 150 mm of joints where the asphalt
being tested is adjacent to asphalt not placed under the same contract."
MRTS30,9.2.2,Determination of insitu air voids,53,54,"The characteristic values of insitu air voids for dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt shall be
determined using the following process:
a) For dense graded asphalt, determine the bulk density either from cores in accordance with
AS/NZS 2891.9.2, Q306C, or from nuclear gauge density measurements taken in accordance
with Q306E or AS.NZS 2891.14.2. Trimming must not reduce the core layer thickness by
more than 5 mm. The nuclear gauge density method is not to be used when steel
reinforcement exists within 300 mm of the surface of the layer.
b) For stone mastic asphalt, determine the bulk density either from cores in accordance with
Q306C, or from nuclear gauge density measurements taken in accordance with Q306E.
Trimming must not reduce the core layer thickness by more than 5 mm. The nuclear gauge
density method is not to be used when steel reinforcement exists within 300 mm of the surface
of the layer.
c) Determine the reference density for the purpose of insitu air voids calculations as the mean
maximum density of the lot, where the individual values are determined in accordance with
AS/NZS 2891.7.1.
d) Calculate the characteristic values of insitu air voids using the acceptance constant 'k'
provided in Table 12(b) of MRTS01 Introduction to Technical Specifications and the following
test methods:
i. Q311 and Q020, or
ii. AS/NZS 2891.14.5 and AS 2891.14.15.
If the Contractor proposes to determine the bulk density of the pavement layer using nuclear gauge
measurements taken in accordance with AS/NZS 2891.14.2 or Q306E, they shall establish an asphalt
density bias on the first lot of each mix design and pavement layer combination constructed as part of
the Works.
The Contractor shall submit a copy of all relevant test results and nuclear gauge density measurement
records used to determine the asphalt density bias. The nuclear gauge may be used for compliance
testing of subsequent lots once these test results and records have been submitted to the
Administrator."
MRTS30,9.3,Surface texture,54,54,"For each construction lot, the average surface texture depth of stone mastic asphalt after gritting shall
not be less than:
• 0.7 mm for SMA10
• 0.7 mm for SMA14 where the posted speed limit is ≤ 80 kilometres per hour, and
• 1.1 mm for SMA14 where the posted speed limit is > 80 kilometres per hour."
MRTS30,9.4.1,General,54,54,"The specified course thickness shall be as detailed on the Drawings. Unless otherwise approved by
the Administrator, asphalt layers shall be placed at an essentially uniform thickness over the areas to
be paved, with due consideration given to the shape of the surface to be paved over.
The pavement shall be constructed so as not to depart from the relevant widths, lengths and levels or
thicknesses stated in the Contract by more than the tolerances listed in Clauses 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.
Where the new asphalt surfacing course is required to match the surface levels of a road structure
(e.g., tie-in to existing pavement or bridge joints, pavement gutter, utility access point, etc.), the
pavement must be constructed so as to drain the surface of water and match the surface levels of the
existing road structure, unless otherwise directed by the Administrator."
MRTS30,9.4.2.1,General,54,55,"There are two alternative methods of vertical tolerance control for asphalt pavements. They are:
a) level control (as detailed in Clause 9.4.2.2), or
b) thickness control (as detailed in Clause 9.4.2.3).

to be adopted is as follows:
a) intermediate, base and corrector courses – level control, and
b) surfacing courses – thickness control."
MRTS30,9.4.2.2,Level control,55,55,"When level control is specified, the levels for the top surface of the course must not vary from the
design levels by more than 10 mm.
Dispositions for nonconformances must be approved before a subsequent course is placed over a
nonconforming course accepted by the Administrator.
Level nonconformities are assessed on the surface of each course rather than on individual layers."
MRTS30,9.4.2.3,Thickness control,55,55,"When thickness control is specified, the requirements for layer thickness shall be as follows:
a) the average compacted layer thickness for each lot, when determined in accordance with
Clause 9.4.2.4(a), shall not vary from the nominated layer thickness by more than the average

b) where the layer being placed is over one or more layers placed by the Contractor, the
thickness of the compacted layer at any point, when measured in accordance with
Clause 9.4.2.4(b), shall not vary from the nominated layer thickness by more than the
individual value tolerance given in Table 9.4.2.3.
For the purposes of this clause, the use of isolated areas of corrector does not constitute a layer.
