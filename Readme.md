# MRTS Bot (TMR MRTS & Standard Drawings QA)

Public Streamlit app to ask questions about TMR MRTS, Standard Drawings, and Tech Notes.
Returns concise answers with exact **clause/page/table/footnote** and **drawing IDs**.
Includes a short **culvert form** and **Download Q&A as PDF**.

## How to use
1. Open the app link (Streamlit Community Cloud).
2. Upload **MRTS PDFs** into `specs` and **Standard Drawings** into `drawings`.
3. Click **Build/Update Index**.
4. Ask your question (e.g., “EME thickness tolerance”, “I want to build a culvert”) and, if needed, fill the short form.
5. Click **Download Q&A as PDF** to save the result.

## Notes
- Standard Drawings must be **RPEQ-certified** for fitness for purpose.
- New/updated content doesn’t automatically apply to in-progress contracts; use **project-pinned versions**.
