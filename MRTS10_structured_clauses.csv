MRTS10,1,Introduction,5,6,"This Technical Specification applies to the construction of road pavements using plant-mixed lightly
bound pavement layers. The intent of this Technical Specification is to produce a lightly bound
granular material with an unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of 1.0 to 2.0 MPa. This Technical
Specification is applicable to lightly bound bases, subbases and improved layers.
This Technical Specification shall be read in conjunction with MRTS01 Introduction to Technical
Specifications, MRTS50 Specific Quality System Requirements and other Technical Specifications as
appropriate.
This Technical Specification forms part of the Transport and Main Roads Specifications Manual.
General
Lightly bound pavement materials are specified with an upper UCS limit of 2.0 MPa to manage the
risk of cracking and a lower limit of 1.0 MPa to ensure sufficient strength is developed in the
material to meet the load capacity intended through the pavement design.
To achieve compliance with the requirements of this Technical Specification and deliver these
materials at the standard required to meet their design intent, a higher level of control over material
constituents and batching may be required compared to what would normally be adopted for
traditional unbound and stabilised pavement materials.
To achieve the requirements of this Technical Specification, collaboration is required between
Contractors and Suppliers.
Lightly Bound Base
Lightly bound base layers have previously been known as “cement modified base” or “CMB” in
Queensland. The term ‘lightly bound base’ has been chosen to align with Austroads terminology.
Lightly bound base layers are typically covered with either a thin asphalt or sprayed bituminous
treatment, with the lightly bound pavement material forming the main structural pavement layer.
These pavements would typically be specified in moderately trafficked pavement applications or
where moisture control is required during construction or throughout the service life of the
pavement.
Lightly Bound Subbase
Lightly bound subbase would typically be specified where additional moisture control is required in
the subbase course.
Improved Layer
Lightly bound improved layers have previously been known as “working platform” layers in
Queensland. The term ‘lightly bound improved layer’ has been chosen to align with Austroads
terminology.
In this application the requirements of this Technical Specification are intended to provide adequate
support conditions beneath a pavement during its design life. These requirements may not be
sufficient for construction traffic or construction activities themselves, and the Contractor may need
to adopt a higher standard to satisfy these requirements.
Where a pavement design includes an unbound granular improved layer, this Technical
Specification is not relevant and reference should be made to MRTS05 Unbound Pavements."
MRTS10,2,Definition of terms,6,7,"The terms used in this Technical Specification shall be as defined in Clause 2 of MRTS01 Introduction
to Technical Specifications. Further definitions are as defined in Table 2.

Term Definition
Actual content of The content of stabilising agent in the production mix
stabilising agent
Allowable working time The time within which compaction and trimming of each lightly bound
pavement layer shall be completed, measured from the commencement
of the incorporation of the stabilising agent (i.e. mixing of the stabilising
agent into the material) to completion of compaction and trimming.
The following activities are not required to be completed in the allowable
working time:
• hard-cut of the surface prior to placing another lightly bound
pavement layer
• static rolling to prepare the surface for sealing, and
• proof rolling.
At the completion of the allowable working time, the layer must comply
with the specified requirements for surface level (excluding
hard-cutting), deviation from a straight edge and surface evenness. That
is, rolling (static or vibratory) or other construction processes are not
permitted after the allowable working time to correct poor geometrics.

With the exception of testing for mix design purposes (as specified in TN204 Mix Design Registration
of plant-mixed cementitiously stabilised pavement material) UCS testing shall be carried out at the
sampled moisture content with the specimen compacted to 100% of (standard) maximum dry
density (MDD).
To achieve compaction of UCS specimens to 100% MDD, the Contractor will need to determine the
mass of material to add to the mould and compact the material using the standard compaction
rammer (2.7 kg) in layers until the material fills the mould.
Where the material is not produced at Optimum Moisture Content (OMC), the Contractor may need
to apply more blows with the standard rammer (that is more than 25 blows per layer) to achieve the
required density (100% MDD).
To calculate the mass of material to be added to the mould the Contractor will need to determine
the moisture content at which the material has been produced at – this may not be OMC."

MRTS10,7.1,Nomination of Registered Mix Design,14,16,"Mix design registration is required to supply plant-mixed cementitiously stabilised materials to
Transport and Main Roads projects, including plant-mixed lightly bound materials. Only current (i.e.
those not expired or suspended) registered mix designs shall be used in the works in accordance with
this Technical Specification.
For each lightly bound pavement material to be incorporated into the Works, the Contractor shall be
responsible for nominating a mix design that consistently conforms with this Technical Specification
and ensuring that the mix design is registered in accordance with TN204 Mix Design Registration of
plant-mixed cementitiously stabilised pavement material.
Where a Lightly Bound Subbase material is specified, the Contractor may nominate a registered
mix design of Lightly Bound Base material to be used in its place.
The Contractor shall nominate the registered mix design, and nominated target content of stabilisation
agent (refer Clause 7.2) to be used and provide the following certificates to the Administrator prior to
the commencement of works. Hold Point 3
1. Stabilised Mix Design Certificate, and
2. Quarry Registration Certificate.
Where there are any changes to the constituent materials used in the production of the nominated
lightly bound pavement materials, including changes to the unbound pavement materials, stabilising
agent, and/or chemical admixtures, the Contractor shall cease using the mix design immediately and
resubmit the mix design application in accordance with TN204 Mix Design Registration of plant-mixed
cementitiously stabilised pavement material, or nominate an alternative registered mix design. Use of
the mix design, or an alternative mix design shall not continue until [Hold Point 3] has been re-
released.
Mix designs that incorporate recycled materials in lightly bound bases may be used when:
• the average daily traffic in the design lane in year of opening is less than 500 Equivalent
Standard Axles (ESAs), (the average daily traffic in the design lane in year of opening is given
in Clause 1 of Annexure MRTS10.1), and
• an asphalt surfacing is provided over the lightly bound base.
There is no restriction on the use of recycled materials in lightly bound subbase or improved layers.
Lightly bound materials may be registered as either 'Quarry' or 'Contractor' mix designs.
'Quarry mix designs' are undertaken directly by the Transport and Main Roads registered quarry
supplying the material. In this instance the mix design remains the property of the quarry and the
Contractor will need to request the relevant certificates be provided by the Quarry. The quarry can
supply the mix design for use by any Contractor undertaking work in accordance with this Technical
Specification.
'Contractor mix designs' are undertaken directly by the Contractor engaged to undertake work in
accordance with this Technical Specification, however, will be applicable only to materials sourced
from a specific Transport and Main Roads registered quarry. In this instance the mix design
remains the property of the Contractor. The Contractor can supply the mix design for use on any
project they are undertaking in accordance with this Technical Specification. Contractor mix
designs cannot be used by other Contractors without the express written permission of the
Contractor who owns the mix design.
When tendering and programming works, Contractors need to be aware of the timeframes needed
to complete and register mix designs. Refer to TN204 Mix Design Registration of plant-mixed
cementitiously stabilised pavement material for further details.
The registration of a mix design does not attest to the Quarry or Contractor's ability to manufacture
or construct a pavement which consistently complies with the requirement of this Technical
Specification. The use of registered mix designs does not reduce or negate the need for testing and
compliance of material on a lot basis as required in the relevant Technical Specification. Where
nonconformances are identified they are to be addressed and rectified in accordance with the
relevant Specification and Technical Specification."
MRTS10,7.2,Nominating target content of stabilising agent,16,16,"Registered mix designs have an 'acceptable range for target content of stabilising agent' determined
through UCS testing.
To allow the release of [Hold Point 3], the Contractor shall nominate a specific Target Content of
Stabilising Agent to be adopted in the production of each lightly bound pavement material, expressed
as a percentage (by dry mass) of unbound pavement material. The nominated target content shall be
within the 'acceptable range for target content of stabilising agent' shown on the Stabilised Mix Design
Certificate.
During construction, the Contractor may adjust the Target Content of Stabilising Agent within the
acceptable target content range. A written notification (including the revised Target Content of
Stabilising Agent) shall be provided to the Administrator prior to producing lightly bound material with
the revised Target Content of Stabilising Agent.

required for each different plant-mixed lightly bound pavement material prior to commencement of the
work involving that material. Witness Point 1
The trial shall not commence until the Administrator has accepted the lightly bound pavement
construction procedure and released Hold Point 1 as specified in Clause 5.2.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the trial pavement must be more than 1000 m².
Subject to the Administrator’s approval, the trial may be incorporated into the permanent works.
The purpose of the trial is to determine:
a) the suitability of the Contractor’s nominated upper and lower moisture content limits and the
ability of the lightly bound pavement layer to comply with the requirements of Clause 8.2.5
b) based on the characteristics of the material, its ability to be handled, spread, and compacted
to achieve the surface finish requirements of Clause 8.2.8.1
c) the adequacy of the joint and surface preparation procedures (including slurrying and the
ability to hard-cut the surface as specified in Clause 8.2.8.2)
d) the rolling pattern and the number of passes of the rollers required to produce an acceptable
compacted layer, and
e) the adequacy or otherwise of the manufacturing and construction plant proposed for the work.
The Contractor shall carry out material and construction compliance tests in accordance with Clause 9
to confirm the trial complies with the requirements of this Technical Specification. Prior to continuing
works after completion of the trial, the Contractor shall submit to the Administrator, for their
acceptance, records which demonstrate this compliance. Hold Point 4 If the trial does not conform in
full to the requirements of this Technical Specification, the Contractor shall review their construction
procedure and mix design and a further trial shall be undertaken.
Where minor nonconformances occur in a trial, and the Administrator accepts to incorporate the lot
into the permanent works (either at a reduced level of service or otherwise), the Administrator, at
their sole discretion may elect to waive the requirement for a further trial to be undertaken.
However, where more significant nonconformances occur, and these or other nonconformances
occur again after a further trial, the Contractor should substantially review their construction
procedure and/or mix design prior to undertaking a subsequent trial."

to ensure placement is essentially continuous throughout a construction lot."
MRTS10,8.2.1.4,Paving equipment,18,18,"Irrespective of what equipment is used, the mix shall be placed and spread such that there is no
segregation of the mixture.
Lightly Bound Base
Unless nominated otherwise in Clause 2.1 of Annexure MRTS10.1, plant-mixed lightly bound base
shall be constructed using a self-propelled spreading machine purpose-built for this work (that is, a
paver). Such machines have the capacity to either:
a) receive the material in a hopper and place and spread the mixture on the prepared surface to
the required uncompacted layer thickness, width and shape in one pass, or
b) spread previously placed windrows of the mixture to the required uncompacted layer
thickness, width and shape in one pass.
Where the lightly bound material is being placed adjacent to a fixed edge or the width of the layer
varies, the paver shall be fitted with a variable width screed.
The Administrator may approve other methods of paving (for example, using a grader) in areas where
the pavement width is such that the use of a paver is not practical. In these instances, the Contractor
shall document the paving equipment to be used and the proposed construction methodology in their
Construction Procedure.
Where a paver is not required as per Clause 2.1 of Annexure MRTS10.1, the plant-mixed lightly bound
base shall be constructed using a grader.

Lightly bound subbase shall be constructed by either using a paver (in accordance with the paving
equipment requirements for lightly bound base) or with a grader, unless specified plant is nominated in
Clause 2.2 of Annexure MRTS10.1.
Lightly Bound Improved Layers
The Contractor may choose to construct lightly bound improved layers using either a paver (in
accordance with the paving equipment requirements for lightly bound base) or with a grader.
General
The Administrator may approve other methods of paving (for example, using small plant) in areas
where the use of a paver or grader is not practical (for example, at turnouts or other isolated areas). In
these instances, the Contractor shall document the paving equipment to be used and the proposed
construction methodology in their Construction Procedure."
MRTS10,8.2.1.5,Equipment for water curing,18,18,"The equipment used for water curing shall be able to discharge water in a fine and even mist over the
layer being cured in a manner that avoids slurrying of the surface and does not result in pavement
instability, erosion, or leeching of the stabilising agent."

specified in Clause 2.3 of Annexure MRTS10.1.
The IC rollers shall meet the following requirements:
a) IC rollers shall be self-propelled vibratory rollers equipped to measure the stiffness of the layer
being compacted.
b) IC rollers shall be capable of recording and displaying:
i. real-time colour-coded maps of the roller position, coverage and stiffness of the
compacted layer
ii. number of roller passes
iii. roller speeds, and
iv. vibration frequency and amplitude of the roller drums.
c) The data output from the IC roller shall be compatible with Veta.
To comply with this clause, all vibrating rollers shall be IC rollers."
MRTS10,8.2.2,Stockpiling of lightly bound pavement material,19,20,"Lightly bound pavement material shall not be stockpiled unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator.
In general, lightly bound pavement material should not be stockpiled unless there are specific
construction requirements. An example of this might be when lightly bound pavement materials are
required to be produced in the afternoon for use during night works (such as in an urban area when
a pug mill is unable to operate at night). In this circumstance the Administrator may approve the
material to be stockpiled provided the mix incorporated a set-retarder to provide a suitable increase
in working time (refer Clause 8.2.3 for further information)."
MRTS10,8.2.3,Allowable working time,20,20,"The time between the commencement of mixing the stabilising agent into the unbound pavement
material and the completion of compaction of a single layer shall be less than the allowable working
time.
The following activities are not required to be completed in the allowable working time:
• hard-cut of the surface prior to placing another lightly bound layer
• static rolling to prepare the surface for sealing, and
• proof rolling.
At the completion of the allowable working time, the layer must comply with the specified requirements
for surface level (excluding hard-cutting), deviation from a straight edge and surface evenness. That
is, rolling (static or vibratory) or other construction processes are not permitted after the allowable
working time to correct geometrics.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator following consultation with the Mix Design Registrar,
the allowable working time for each plant-mixed lightly bound pavement material shall be the lesser of:
a) the tested working time shown on the Stabilised Mix Design Certificate, and
b) four hours.
Increasing the allowable working time beyond four hours would not generally be approved unless
significant constraints exist. Such examples might include:
• night works in urban areas requiring the mixing of materials at times when the pug mill is
unable to operate (for example, due to noise restrictions), or
• where no suppliers are available locally, and extended travel times would significantly
restrict the ability to construct the pavement within the working time.
In these circumstances, the Contractor should provide justification as to the reason for any
proposed increase in allowable working time. In no circumstance should the allowable working time
be extended beyond the tested working time shown on the Stabilised Mix Design Certificate.
Allowing extended working times where they are not warranted encourages poor construction
practice and lead to variability in moisture content during construction."
MRTS10,8.2.4,Weather conditions for construction,21,21,"Lightly bound pavements shall not be manufactured (by blended the stabilising agent with the
unbound pavement material) or constructed:
a) when the air temperature is less than 10ºC or greater than 40ºC, unless otherwise approved
by the Administrator
b) during rain or when rain is likely to fall during placement, or
c) when the evaporation rate due to the combined effect of air temperature, wind and relative
humidity may result in excessive drying of the lightly bound pavement layers surface.
The default temperature requirements specified represent the preferred conditions to place lightly
bound materials. When assessing a proposal to place lightly bound materials outside of these
requirements the Administrator should consider the following:
• When the air temperature is greater than 40ºC, the allowable working time may need to be
reduced below the normal specification requirements.
• When the air temperature is less than 10ºC, the material may take significantly longer to
set-up requiring an extended time prior to being trafficked."
MRTS10,8.2.5,Moisture content of the mixture,21,21,"The Contractor shall nominate upper and lower moisture content limits as part of their construction
procedures that will ensure:
a) there is adequate moisture to achieve the specified compaction standard
b) the constructed lightly bound pavement layer is trafficked in accordance with requirements of
Clause 8.2.11, and
c) the lightly bound pavement material does not exceed the optimum moisture content (OMC),
determined in accordance with Test Method Q142A.
Moisture must be uniformly distributed within each layer. At all times the moisture content of the
material must be within the Contractor’s nominated upper and lower moisture content limits.
During placement and compaction of the lightly bound pavement material, where permitted by the
Administrator, water may be added onsite as a fine mist (with no run off), to compensate for drying out
of the surface of the layer. Water shall not be added onsite to re-moisture condition the material for
compaction.
It is recommended that prior to the commencement of construction that the Contractor and
Administrator agree the circumstances under which the Contractor would be allowed to add water
onsite. Typically this would be based on environmental factors such as temperate and wind drying
the surface of the pavement.
Adding water onsite should not be used to compensate for inadequate moisture being added during
production or poor handling and placement techniques delaying works onsite."
MRTS10,8.2.6,Paving,22,22,"Lightly bound pavements shall be constructed such that each individual layer is laid in one pass that
meets the requirements of this Technical Specification without the addition of extra material except as
detailed below.
The material laid ready for compaction shall not have any visible areas of segregation. Any
segregated areas are to be removed and replaced with fresh mix prior to the commencement of
compaction of the lot. Material removed for this reason shall be disposed of in accordance with
Clause 10 of MRTS01 Introduction to Technical Specifications and shall trigger a nonconformance,
under which the Contractor must identify the cause of the segregation and propose preventative action
to prevent reoccurrence. Nonconformance"
MRTS10,8.2.7.1,Layer thickness,22,22,"Individual compacted layer thicknesses shall be chosen to suit the construction process and the
requirements of the Contract. Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the completed layer
thicknesses (after compaction and surface preparation) shall be in accordance with Table 8.2.7.1.
Table 8.2.7.1 – Layer thickness requirements
Material Minimum Value Maximum Value
Lightly Bound Pavement
125 mm 250 mm
Materials
Except in batters, each layer shall be constructed in a uniform thickness unless otherwise approved by
the Administrator.
Where multiple layers of the same lightly bound pavement material are placed together in a single
course each layer shall be of equal thickness, unless otherwise approved by the Administrator.
Constructing multiple layers in a single course to the same thickness is intended to promote
uniformity of each layer. However, there may be circumstances where this requirement is not able
to be satisfied, such as where kerb and channel is being constructed. In such instances the
Administrator may allow this requirement to be relaxed.
To achieve the minimum compaction standard specified, the Contractor may need to employ larger
rollers than may normally be used. Particularly where layer thicknesses are towards the maximum
allowable limit, not less than one 21 tonne (minimum weight) vibrating steel drum roller should be
used to compact plant-mixed lightly bound pavements, unless the Contractor can demonstrate that
the required standards can be achieved with a smaller roller.
Additional rollers, including pneumatic (multi-tyred) rollers, may also be used."
MRTS10,8.2.7.2,Preparation of a lightly bound layer prior to placing the next lightly bound layer,23,24,"Where a lightly bound pavement layer is to be overlaid directly with another lightly bound pavement
layer (within the same course or not), the finished surface shall be hard-cut:
• after the completion of compaction, and
• within the same work shift as the material was placed unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator.
Hard-cutting the surface shall uniformly roughen the surface across the full width of the layer.
Scratching or marking the surface is not sufficient.
The Contractor will nominate in their Construction Procedure the proposed methodology to hard-cut
the pavement. The hard-cut may be undertaken using a grader (with a straight blade, serrated
blade or toothed blade), by heavy brooming or with other plant. The nominated hard-cut process
should be assessed as part of the paving trial.
Where the construction process does not allow the lightly bound pavement layer to be hard-cut
within the same work shift as the material was placed, the Administrator may approve the
Contractor to delay the hard-cut process provided the Contractor can demonstrate that their
nominated process will achieve an acceptable surface. The longer a lightly bound material is left
prior to hard-cut, the more effort will be needed to hard-cut the surface and the more chance there
is of damaging the pavement if inappropriate equipment is chosen (e.g. using a grader with straight
blade to hard-cut cured lightly bound pavement).
Figure 8.2.7.2 – Example of acceptable hard-cut surface
Unless the overlying layer is being constructed in the same work shift, a cement slurry (refer
Clause 6.4) shall be applied to the hard-cut surface prior to placing the next lightly bound pavement
layer.
The surface shall be thoroughly swept with a road broom immediately prior to placement of the slurry
or overlying layer. All foreign and loose material, including lenses of pavement material, shall be
removed from the surface.
Success has been achieved on many projects using basic and readily available equipment to pump
and spray the slurry onto the surface. This method also allows slurry application rates to be
achieved accurately and significantly reduces wastage and excess run-off.
All hard-cut material shall be disposed of in accordance with Clause 10 of MRTS01 Introduction to
Technical Specifications."
MRTS10,8.2.7.3,Placing multiple layers,24,24,"Multiple layers shall not be placed over one another within the same work shift unless otherwise
approved by the Administrator.
Where the Administrator permits multiple layers to be placed in the same work shift, the requirements
of Clause 8.2.7.2 shall apply – that is:
• The underlying layer shall be hard-cut, and
• A cement slurry is not required between the layers.
This clause is intended to be used in circumstances where there are significant benefits to the
Principal from placing multiple layers in a single shift, and should not be applied to general
construction. Accepting multiple layers to be placed in a single shift places increased risk on the
Principal.
This provision would mainly be considered where road closures require accelerated construction
and the Principal wishes to utilise lightly bound pavement material (as opposed to an alternative
material such as asphalt).
For an Administrator to permit placing multiple layers in the same work shift, the Principal may need
to relax the requirements of Hold Point 5 (refer Clause 9.5.1) with regards to proof rolling and time
of compaction testing (not compaction conformance). Note that:
• As specified in Table A1 of Appendix A, a lot of lightly bound pavement material is a
continuous single layer constructed in one days production.
• As specified in Clause 9.5.1, each lot shall be conformed prior to being covered with the
subsequent layer of pavement.
Where a Contractor wishes to utilise this provision, this should be specifically agreed during the
tender process."
MRTS10,8.2.8,Surface finish,25,25,"Notwithstanding the requirements for hard-cutting – from when the layer is presented to the
Administrator for inspection (refer Hold Point 5), until immediately prior to covering, the finished
surface of any lightly bound pavement layer shall:
• be hard and homogenous in appearance
• not be friable when subject to mechanical brooming
• not have transverse shrinkage cracks
• not have any loose, segregated or contaminated areas
• have the course particles slightly exposed
• not be affected by delamination
• not show signs of water pumping, and
• not visibly deflect under load when proof rolled in accordance with Clause 9.4.10.
For layers that are to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment, the surface shall have a
maximum ball penetration value that complies with Clause 8.3.8.
Where a lightly bound pavement layer is required to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment,
particular attention needs to be given to the surface finish of the lightly bound pavement layer in
order to ensure good adhesion. This is particularly relevant when the treatment includes polymer
modified bitumen.
The following factors are important to ensure the successful adhesion of a sprayed bituminous
treatment:
• All dust must be removed from the pavement immediately before spraying
• Compaction of the lightly bound pavement material may form a thin lens of dried slurry on
the surface of the pavement. This can appear hard, however may be prone to ‘shattering’
or delamination and should be removed before spraying, and
• Variation in the surface ‘tightness’ may warrant the specification of either an AMC0 or
AMC00 prime (or an equivalent emulsion prime accepted by the Administrator). The
effectiveness of any prime should be assessed in field trials.
Inadequate curing can lead to an excessively dusty surface, which may be difficult to prepare. To
address this, curing should be undertaken to ensure the pavement remains continuously damp."
MRTS10,8.2.9,Curing and covering of constructed layers,25,26,"Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, each layer of lightly bound pavement shall be
covered with the next layer and/or a bituminous surfacing within seven days of placement.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, lightly bound layers must not be covered with a
sprayed seal (including a prime) within 48 hours of placement or rainfall.
At the completion of its construction, the surface of any layer shall be water cured until placement of
the next layer of lightly bound pavement or the first layer of a bituminous surfacing is applied.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, water curing shall be completed in accordance with
Clause 8.2.1.5.
The number of applications of water shall be such that the surface remains continuously damp.
Water curing will need to cease to allow dry back of the surface prior to covering a lightly bound
layer with either asphalt or a sprayed bituminous treatment. The timeframe for this dry back should
be agreed between the Contractor and Administrator taking into consideration material and
environmental conditions at the time, however the period of time that the layer is not being cured
should be minimised to the greatest extent possible."
MRTS10,8.2.10,Construction joints between adjacent paving runs,26,26,"To the extent practical, the Contractor shall spread the lightly bound pavement material in a manner
that minimises the number of joints.
Joints shall be constructed such that the material at the joints complies in all ways with the
requirements of this Technical Specification.
Longitudinal joints must comply with the following requirements unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator:
a) joints shall be offset by a minimum of 150 mm from joints in the underlying layers, except
where required otherwise to achieve the design shape (for example to construct a crowned
pavement)
b) joints shall be located away from trafficked wheel paths, and
c) joints in the final (uppermost) layer of lightly bound bases shall coincide with the final traffic
lane markings and/or line of change in crossfall (for example, crown of the pavement).
Transverse joints must be offset by a minimum of 2.0 m from a joint in any underlying layer, unless
otherwise approved by the Administrator.
The Administrator may approve longitudinal joints in the final (uppermost) layer of the base course
to be constructed away from lane markings where this represents the best outcome to achieve the
pavement design intent. For example, when paving a single lane ramp with wide shoulders, the
Administrator may allow the Contractor to form a single longitudinal joint along the centre of the
ramp rather than paving the ramp lane between the edge line markings and the subsequently
paving shoulders on either side."
MRTS10,8.2.10.1,Fresh joints,26,27,"A construction joint shall be deemed ‘fresh’ when the material on each side of the joint has been
stabilised, placed and compacted within the allowable working time (refer Clause 8.2.2) of the material
that was laid first.
To construct a fresh joint between adjoining or adjacent runs, the outside 300 mm of material from the
first run shall be left uncompacted until the adjacent material is ready for compaction.
When compacting the fresh mix against the face of the existing layer, the roller shall be partly
supported on the previously compacted portion of the layer that was laid first."
MRTS10,8.2.10.2,Other joints,27,27,"Joints that are not fresh shall have the edge of the existing layer cut back to form a neat, clean,
vertical face. The cut back distance shall be the greater of:
a) the distance required to cut back into the area of existing material that is compacted to the
standard specified in Clause 8.3.4, or
b) 150 mm.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, immediately before placing an adjoining or adjacent
layer, the cut back edge of the existing layer shall have a cement slurry applied (refer Clause 6.4).
All cut back material shall be disposed of in accordance with Clause 10 of MRTS01 Introduction to
Technical Specifications."
MRTS10,8.2.11,Trafficking during construction,27,27,"Unless otherwise specified in Clause 3 of Annexure MRTS10.1 or approved otherwise by the
Administrator, lightly bound pavement layers shall not be opened to either construction traffic (other
than needed to construct the lot) or general traffic until the lot has been tested for, and passes proof
rolling in accordance with Clause 9.4.10.
Where the lightly bound base is permitted to be traffic, the requirements for curing as per this
Technical Specification must still be complied with."
MRTS10,8.2.12,Contractor's responsibilities,27,27,"The Contractor shall maintain each layer such that it complies with all aspects of this Technical
Specification until it has been overlaid with another pavement layer or surfaced with the final wearing
surface, and then until the end of the defect liability period or as otherwise required under the
Contract."
MRTS10,8.3.1,Segregation,27,27,"Segregation is the uneven distribution of particle sizes. The construction process shall control
segregation so that the particle size distribution of the lightly bound pavement material complies with
the particle size distribution requirements of the specified unbound pavement material prior to the
commencement of compaction.
Where there are visible signs of segregation in any lot prior to the commencement of compaction, the
Administrator may direct the area to be tested for conformance with the above requirements.
As the addition of stabilising agents is intended to bind unbound pavement materials, care needs to
be taken in determining if a mix has in fact segregated. Typically, if segregation testing is
undertaken for lightly bound pavement materials, the proportion of the grading passing the 2.36 mm
sieve would be disregarded."
MRTS10,8.3.2,Actual content of stabilising agent,28,28,"The actual content of stabilising agent during production (determined using Test Method Q134) shall
comply with the requirements specified in Table 8.3.2.

As shown in Table 8.3.3, the conformance requirement for UCS is report only – that is individual
UCS results are not assessed on their own for conformance. Clauses 9.5.2 and 9.5.3 set out the
requirements to assess UCS on a process control basis, where by multiple UCS results outside of
the target range may constitute a mix design review or resubmission of the mix design."

For each lot, the accuracy of the system used to dispense stabilising agent shall be verified by
reconciliation between:
a) The stabilising agent used
The actual (measured) amount of stabilising agent added to the pug mill (refer Clause 8.2.1.2)
to produce the lot, and
b) The amount of unbound pavement material used
The amount of unbound pavement material used in the lightly bound pavement material shall
be established based on the wet mass of mixture, as shown on weighbridge records, adjusted
to a dry mass (using the average measured moisture content of the mixture for the Lot), minus
the mass of stabilising agent used.
The average stabilising agent content can then be calculated as a percentage by dry mass of the
unbound pavement material.
Alternatively, for assessment of the accuracy of the system, the Contractor may propose an alternative
compliance method, such as one that includes a continuous (real time) data collection system of the
throughput mass of all constituent materials. Any proposed alternative must be approved by the
Administrator prior to use.
Example of approach to calculate average stabilising agent content:
The stabilising agent used
• production records shown 3 tonnes of stabilising agent was added to the pug-mill to
produce a lot
The amount of lightly bound pavement material produced
• weight bridge records show a total of 200 tonnes of lightly bound pavement materials was
produced in the same lot
• moisture content testing for the lot returned an average result of 7.5%
• the equivalent dry tonnage of the mixture would therefore be calculated as 186 tonnes
• the equivalent dry tonnage of unbound pavement material used would be 183 tonnes
• the average stabilising agent content is therefore 1.64%
Testing for mixing plant variability is not intended to assess the plant performance during
production against the MPV nominated in the mix design process.
While there is no specific specification limit for this property, excessive variation in the actual mixing
plant variability during production should be investigated by the Contractor, and consideration given
to reviewing process controls accordingly."
MRTS10,9.4.8,Moisture content,34,34,"Minimum testing frequencies for moisture content testing shall be as specified in Table A2 and
Table A3 of Appendix A.
The moisture content of each lot shall be represented by the individual moisture content results."
MRTS10,9.4.9,Unconfined compressive strength,34,35,"Minimum testing frequencies for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) testing shall be as specified
in Table A2 of Appendix A.
When UCS tests are being undertaken, the sample being used must also be tested for stabilising
agent content and moisture content.
Conformance testing for UCS and stabilising agent content must be undertaken in accordance with
the time requirements given in the respective Test Methods. Under normal circumstances, these
tests would all be undertaken on samples taken from material being discharged directly from the
pug mill. These results would therefore represent material properties at the point of production.
Material properties at the point of placement are controlled by ensuring materials are placed within
the allowable working time, which allows a reduction in both the UCS and maximum dry density of
the material as detailed in Test Method Q136A. However, there is no specific requirements that the
material is tested for conformance in this regard."
MRTS10,9.4.10,Proof rolling,35,35,"Each lightly bound pavement layer shall be tested for perceptible surface deformation by ‘proof rolling’
the pavement, in the presence of the Administrator Witness Point 2 All areas of lightly bound
pavements shall be proof rolled, including all trafficked lanes, shoulders and other areas.
Testing shall be undertaken in accordance with Test Method Q723. Testing for perceptible surface
deformation is exempt from the requirement for NATA accreditation or Construction Material Testing
(CMT) registration.
In areas where perceptible surface deformation is observed, the Contractor shall remove and replace
the affected section, or take other corrective action to the satisfaction of the Administrator. In doing so,
the Administrator may require the Contractor to carry out additional compliance testing to ensure that
the affected section of pavement complies with Clause 8.2.5 and 8.3.4. No additional payment will be
made by the Principal for any such additional testing.
The proof rolling result reported for any lot shall be representative of the condition of the lot
immediately prior to it being covered by another pavement layer. If the pavement lot has been
subjected to rainfall or moisture ingress in any way since proof rolling was undertaken, the
Administrator may direct the Contractor to retest the lot to prove conformance. If the retested results
do not comply with the requirements of this Technical Specification, the Contractor shall dry back
and/or reprepare the pavement such that it complies with the requirements of this Technical
Specification. No additional payment will be made by the Principal for any such additional efforts.
Test Method Q723 provides a method for using either a 7,000 L single rear axle or 10,000 L
tandem rear axle loaded water tanker for proof rolling."
MRTS10,9.4.11,Ball penetration,35,36,"For lightly bound pavement layers that are to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment, the
Contractor shall undertake ball penetration testing in accordance with Test Method AG:PT/T251 on
the completed layer prior to undertaking the sprayed bituminous treatment.
Minimum testing frequencies for ball penetration testing shall be as specified in Table A3 of
Appendix A.
In accordance with Test Method AG:PT/T251, ball penetration results shall be reported as both
individual and average values.
For the average value to be adopted for lot conformance and seal design purposes, the results
must be representative of a homogeneous section of pavement. Any areas represented by
excessively low or high individual values should be considered for sub-lotting and may require
additional construction or testing actions before they can be incorporated into the final works. Any
such works shall be undertaken by the Contractor at no cost to the Principal.
The ball penetration result reported for any lot shall be representative of the condition of the lot
immediately prior to it being covered. If the pavement lot has been subjected to rainfall or moisture
ingress in any way since ball penetration testing was undertaken, the Administrator may direct the
Contractor to retest the lot to prove conformance. If the retested results do not comply with the
requirements of this Technical Specification, the Contractor shall dry back and/or reprepare the
pavement such that it complies with the requirements of this Technical Specification. No additional
payment will be made by the Principal for any such additional efforts."
MRTS10,9.4.12,Geometrics & deviation from a straight edge,36,36,"Minimum testing frequencies for geometric tolerances and deviation from a straight edge shall be as
specified in Table A4 of Appendix A.
Horizontal position, vertical levels, crossfall and layer thickness shall be determined by survey unless
otherwise agreed by the Administrator."
MRTS10,9.4.13,Road roughness (surface evenness),36,36,"The road roughness of the final (uppermost) layer of all lightly bound bases shall be measured by
Test Methods Q708B, Q708C or Q708D.
For road roughness testing, a lot shall be 100 m in length.
Road roughness testing is not required to be undertaken on lightly bound subbases and improved
layers.
The Administrator may waive the requirement for roughness testing where the lightly bound base
will be overlayed with asphalt or another pavement material within the same Contract and there is a
roughness requirement specified elsewhere in the Contract for the overlying layer."
MRTS10,9.5.1,Acceptance of lots,36,37,"Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, no layer of lightly bound pavement shall be covered
by a subsequent layer of pavement or by a surfacing until Hold Point 5:
a) all testing has been completed (other than UCS testing)
b) the surface finish of the layer complies with the requirements of Clause 8.2.8
c) all test results comply with the requirements of this Technical Specification, or any non-
conformances have been submitted, with corrective actions proposed by the Contractor, and
accepted by the Administrator
d) the layer has been presented to the Administrator for inspection, and
e) the As-Constructed Survey requirements of the lot have been met as specified in
MRTS56 Construction Surveying and notice of such works has been provided to the
Administrator."
MRTS10,9.5.2,Control charts,37,37,"For each lightly bound pavement lot, the Contractor shall submit control charts which show the
following properties for that lot and all previous lots of the same lightly bound material produced under
the Contract:
• Liquid limit
• Linear shrinkage
• UCS
• Stabilising agent content, and
• Actual moisture content (sampled at plant).
Appendix B provides some examples of lot control charts. The Contractor may choose to provide
control charts for additional properties."
MRTS10,9.5.3,Mix design review,37,37,"From the control charts provided under Clause 9.5.2, when more than five out of the most recent"
MRTS10,20,"(or less) production UCS test results are outside of the target limits specified in Table 8.3.3, the",37,38,"Contractor shall review the material production (using the control charts), to validate that the intent of
the mix design requirements specified in TN204 Mix Design Registration of plant-mixed cementitiously
stabilised pavement material is being achieved.
Within seven days of triggering this clause the Contractor shall submit a proposal, to the satisfaction of
the Administrator, to:
• address the root cause, and
• bring the production UCS result back in line with the target requirements specified in
Table 8.3.3.
In addition to the Administrator, on Transport and Main Roads projects the proposal shall also be
submitted to the Mix Design Registrar by emailing stabilisedmixdesign@tmr.qld.gov.au.
When more than 12 of the most recent 40 (or less) production UCS test results are outside of the
target limits specified in Table 8.3.3, the Contractor shall cease using the nominated mix design.
Hold Point 6 Use of the mix design, or an alternative mix design shall not continue until
[Hold Point 3] has been re-released.
Where the process control charts show production UCSs trending towards the lower or upper side
of the target range, the Contractor should increase or decrease the nominated 'target content of
stabilising agent'. Provided the amended 'target content of stabilising agent' is within the acceptable
target content range shown on the Stabilised Mix Design Certificate, a new mix design registration
is not needed.
Where the nominated 'target content of stabilising agent' needs to be decreased, but the required
target content cannot be effectively blended, the Contractor should revise the mix design to use an
alternative stabilising agent."
