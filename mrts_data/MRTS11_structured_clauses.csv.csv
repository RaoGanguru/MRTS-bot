Clause 5 of MRTS50 Specific Quality System Requirements. These shall include, but are not limited
to:
• procedures for handling, storage, transport, heating and transfer of binder in accordance with
the requirements of Clause 8 of MRTS17 Bitumen and Multigrade Bitumen or Clauses 5.2 and"
MRTS11,8,of MRTS18 Polymer Modified Binder (including Crumb Rubber) and this Technical,11,12,"Specification as appropriate
• enhanced construction procedures, if sealing works will be undertaken during cold weather
(refer Clauses 11.2 and 11.3) and other high-risk situations, and
• procedures that prevent:
wash-off of bituminous material used to prime pavement surfaces, and
o
environmental harm that may result from the wash-off of this material.
o
Enhanced construction procedures are typically adopted when sealing during cold weather
conditions and other high-risk situations. Such procedures typically ensure the following:
a) the aggregate is in an ideal condition state, i.e. ≤ 10% stripping value when tested in
accordance with Q212B and free from surface moisture at the time of sealing
b) aggregate spreading occurs without delay after the binder is sprayed on the road surface
(which typically requires the use of shorter spray runs)
c) aggregate is rolled into the binder without delay after spreading occurs
d) additional aggregate spreaders and rollers are used to ensure the aggregate is spread and
rolled into the binder more quickly than would normally be the case, and
e) ensuring the specified number of passes are applied to the seal by using Coverage
Tracking rollers during the construction process.
TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions provides guidance on additional measures that can be
implemented when sealing in cold weather conditions. Specific additional measures that must be
included in the construction procedures are detailed in Clauses 5, 6.1 and 6.3 of Annexure
MRTS11.1.
The Contractor shall establish an Inspection and Test Plan (ITP) for supply and delivery of binder. The
Inspection and Test Plan shall address at least:

7.To be nominated in Clause 2 of Annexure MRTS11.1 or on the Drawings.
Transport and Main Roads has limited experience with the use of S15R and S15RF binder grades
for WP-A treatments and the risk associated with the seal binder bleeding through the asphalt in
hot weather has not yet been assessed. Similarly, the department has limited experience with the
use of blends of bitumen and crumb rubber in geotextile reinforced seals. Usage of these binder
grades in these applications should be limited to small scale trials until more experience is gained
with these scenarios.
Further advice should be sought from the Principal Engineer (Sprayed Seals and Binders) when
conducting these trials.
For all treatments to be incorporated into the Works, the treatment type, binder class, cover aggregate
nominal size(s) and estimated application rates are specified in Clause 2 of Annexure MRTS11.1."
MRTS11,6.1.2,Use of an alternative binder class,14,16,"Where a particular polymer modified binder class has been specified for a sprayed bituminous
treatment, the Contractor may use an equivalent alternative binder class provided:
a) it complies with the requirements of Table 6.1.2(a)
b) the sprayed bituminous treatment conforms with all the requirements of this Technical
Specification (including uniformity of binder application and limits for cutter oil content)
c) its use does not impact on the construction program, and
d) its use does not increase the cost of the sprayed bituminous treatment.
The equivalent alternative binder classes listed in Table 6.1.2(a) can be used as an alternative to
the binder class specified without the need for Administrator approval for the following reasons:
a) they will provide long-term performance that is equivalent to the binder class specified, and
b) they can be applied at the same spray rate as the binder class specified (as the same
‘polymer factor’ is used for the seal design).

Approval to use alternative polymer modified binder classes not listed in Table 6.1.2(a)
The alternative binder classes listed in Table 6.1.2(b) are typically considered to be acceptable
alternatives to the binder class specified. However, as the use of these alternative binder classes
will result in a change to the binder application rate, Administrator approval is required prior to use.
The Administrator would typically use the following criteria to evaluate these proposals:
• compliance with Clause 6.1.2 requirements,
• no increase in the cost of the treatment ($/m²), and
• no increase in the unit rate for the binder ($/L).
The Administrator should refer to the department’s Technical Note TN175 for appropriate ‘polymer
factors’ when evaluating the cost implications of these proposals.

Cutter oil which is suspected as being water contaminated shall be investigated and, if found to be
water contaminated, shall not be used."
MRTS11,8.2,Cover aggregate,20,20,"Cover aggregate shall not be exposed to contaminating agents, particularly dust, and shall be handled
so as to avoid contamination and any other deleterious effects. Unless otherwise stated in Clause 4.2
of Annexure MRTS11.1, cover aggregate shall be protected with a light plastic or similar material to
prevent the ingress of moisture and other contaminants. The protective material shall be sufficiently
anchored to ensure the optimal fixture that can be achieved consistent with the protective material
properties. Witness Point 1"
MRTS11,8.3.1,Delivery (storage and transport),20,20,"Binder shall be delivered to the Works in accordance with Clause 8 of MRTS17 Bitumen and

Heating requirements shall be strictly observed. Witness Point 3"
MRTS11,8.3.3,Incorporation of additives,20,21,"Volatile additives, e.g. cutter and flux oils, shall not be heated and shall be introduced into the sprayer
tank through the sprayer’s pumping system. Volatile additives shall not be added to the top of hot
bitumen.
Non-volatile additives, e.g. adhesion agent, shall be introduced into the sprayer tank through the
sprayer's pumping system in accordance with any relevant standards and/or manufacturer’s
instructions.
Additive shall be incorporated in accordance with Transport and Main Roads’ Registered Product List
for Binder Adhesion Agents.
The appropriate concentration of binder adhesion agent to be used (% expressed as parts by
volume) will depend on the particular characteristics of the aggregate as well as the product’s
performance level. As a guide, the following are suggested:
• For Level 1 products, an adhesion agent concentration of 0.3% should be used for
aggregates with average adhesion properties, and 0.6% for difficult aggregates known to
possess high stripping tendencies
• For Level 2 and Level 3 products, increasingly higher adhesion agent concentrations will be
required but should not exceed 1.0%, and
• Adhesion agent concentrations should be doubled when using polymer modified binders
but should not exceed 1.0%.
Use of adhesion agent concentrations above those suggested may cause cutting of the binder with
little improvement in adhesion promoting properties.
When additive is incorporated:
a) the additive shall be dissolved in hot binder, and
b) the hot binder and additive shall be circulated, after the addition of the last component, at a
rate of at least 1000 litres per minute for a period until the sprayer contents have been
circulated twice.
Where adhesion agent is to be used, the binder shall then be sprayed as promptly as field
circumstances allow and within three hours. If the binder and adhesion agent has not been sprayed
within three hours, additional adhesion agent may be added to the remaining binder at a dosage
concentration then equivalent to one third of the original adhesion agent dosage."

b) not less than the minimum specified rolling is achieved (refer to Clause 14.5).
Additional requirements, if any, relating to programming of spray operations are given in Clause 6.1 of
Annexure MRTS11.1."
MRTS11,11.1,Availability of cover aggregate,23,23,"Prior to commencement of bitumen spraying operations on any day, the Contractor shall provide the
Administrator with evidence that sufficient uncontaminated, precoated cover aggregate of the relevant
category, nominal size and specified properties is available for the extent of bitumen spraying work to
be undertaken on that day. Hold Point 6"
MRTS11,11.2,Pavement temperature,23,24,"Spraying shall not commence until the temperature of the pavement surface is above the temperature
given in Clause 6.2 of Annexure MRTS11.1 or, if not so given, the pavement temperature listed below
for at least one hour before spraying commences:
a) 10ºC for primes
b) 15ºC for initial seals containing AMC5 to AMC6 cutback bitumen

crumb rubber, and
d) 25ºC for treatments containing polymer modified binders (other than crumb rubber binders)
(i.e. S10E, S15E, S20E, S25E and S35E binder classes), unless the Administrator has given
written permission to relax the temperature to a minimum of 20ºC. Witness Point 4
Spraying shall not continue unless all operations up to the completion of the minimum rolling, as
specified in Clause 14.5, can be completed before the temperature of the pavement surface drops
below the temperature given in Clause 6.2 of Annexure MRTS11.1 or, if not so given, the minimum
temperatures listed in this clause.
These minimum pavement surface temperature limits do not apply to WP-A and SAMI treatments that
are:
a) placed over an existing seal or asphalt, and
b) overlaid with asphalt prior to trafficking.
In some situations, the Principal may limit the maximum amount of cutter oil to be used for long
term performance reasons (e.g. reduce the potential for bleeding during the first period of hot
weather after the works are completed). In these situations, consideration should be given to either:
• increasing the minimum pavement temperature limits for spraying in Clause 6.2 of
Annexure MRTS11.1 using Table 12.7 as guidance, and/or
• require the adoption of enhanced construction procedures for the spreading and rolling of
cover aggregate into the binder."
MRTS11,11.3,Weather conditions,24,25,"Generally, sprayed bituminous treatments should be programmed for construction during
favourable (i.e. warm and dry) conditions. TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions provides
guidance on the time of year when sprayed sealing works should be programmed to minimise the
risk of stripping (early failure by loss of aggregate) due to cold weather early in the life of a sprayed
bituminous treatment.
Spraying shall not take place during rain or if rain is likely to fall prior to the spreading of cover
aggregate and the completion of rolling.
The Contractor shall stop sealing immediately if rainfall occurs during sealing operations. Any seal
sprayed during rainfall or on a wet surface shall be rejected.
Spraying shall not take place during winds of greater than 30 km/h or during dust storms.
Clause 6.3 of Annexure MRTS11.1 nominates the time of year when the application of sprayed
bituminous treatments that will be trafficked by the public at speeds greater than 40 km/h is either:
a) not permitted, or
b) requires the implementation of additional measures as nominated in Clause 6.3 of Annexure
MRTS11.1 to minimise the risk of early life stripping. The risk mitigation measures nominated
in Clause 6.3 of Annexure MRTS11.1 are minimum requirements and the Contractor may
choose to implement additional measures to manage risks associated with sealing during cold
weather conditions.
The months of the year when application of sprayed bituminous treatments is not permitted and the
months of the year when additional measures must be implemented to minimise the risk of stripping
due to cold weather should be determined for each project location in accordance with
TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions. Relying on the default requirements in Clause 11.3 is
not recommended.
Where no indication is given in Clause 6.3 of Annexure MRTS11.1, the following shall apply for
sprayed bituminous treatments (other than initial seals) that will be trafficked at speeds greater than"
MRTS11,40,km/h by the public:,25,25,"a) spraying is not permitted during the months of June to August (inclusive), and
b) requires the implementation of additional measures during the months of May and September
to minimise the risk of early life stripping.
Where the implementation of additional measures is required to minimise the risk of early life stripping,
the contractor must submit their procedures to the Administrator for review not less than 14 days prior
to the commencement of spraying.
Spraying shall not commence until these procedures have been deemed suitable by the Administrator.
Hold Point 7
TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions provides guidance regarding possible risk mitigation
measures when sealing during cold weather conditions.
Where sealing is to occur during the time of year when the Sealing Risk Level is Level 2, the
Administrator must review the additional measures to be implemented by the Contractor to reduce
the risk of early life stripping.
Where sealing is to occur during the time of year when the Sealing Risk Level is Level 3 (i.e. the
highest risk level) in accordance with TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions, the Administrator
must obtain approval from the District Director prior to the commencement of spraying. If approved
by the District Director, appropriate risk mitigation measures, consistent with the requirements for
Sealing Risk Level 2, must be implemented.
The relevant details of this procedure are to be documented by the Administrator in the Project
Details and Authority to Proceed forms contained in TN186 Sealing in Cold Weather Conditions."
MRTS11,11.4,Minimum period between bituminous treatments,25,26,"Unless otherwise stated in Clauses 6.4 and 6.5 of Annexure MRTS11.1, the minimum periods of time
between bituminous treatments shall be:
a) a prime shall not be covered with a secondary treatment and/or asphalt until both of the
following conditions are satisfied:
i. the prime shall be completely dry and trafficable by light construction traffic (< 20 vehicles
per day), and
ii. the prime has been placed for a minimum period of 3 days.
All traffic shall be kept off the primed surface unless prime cover material has been
applied.
b) between an initial seal, secondary treatment or retreatment containing > 2% by volume cutter
oil and subsequent bituminous treatment (such as a secondary treatment, retreatment or
asphalt) at the same location, the minimum period is:
i. 3 months in warm weather (minimum nightly temperatures > 10ºC), and
ii. at least 6 months in cooler conditions (minimum nightly temperatures ≤ 10ºC).
The minimum curing periods to be adopted should be based on local experience and must consider
the environmental conditions and traffic loading during the curing period as well as the binder
class / category, amount of cutter oil, and nominal size(s) of aggregate used. The default minimum
periods between an initial seal and a secondary treatment typically results in adequate curing of the
initial seal binder to avoid performance related issues associated with insufficient curing.
Adoption of shorter curing periods (than the default minimums) may require an adjustment (i.e. a
reduction in the binder application rate) to the seal design based on local experience.
Insufficient curing may lead to bleeding of the overlying treatment during the next period of
significant hot weather.
Delaying the application of a secondary treatment to an initial seal excessively may lead to
deterioration of the initial seal by the action of traffic, particularly during periods of hot weather,
where the initial seal is subject to heavy traffic and/or high shear stresses (such as intersections or
sharp curves).
c) prior to asphalt overlay, SAMI treatments shall not be left exposed for more than 2 days when
subject to traffic other than construction vehicles. Where SAMI treatments are trafficked by
only construction traffic, aggregate removed from the SAMI binder by construction traffic shall
be replaced prior to asphalt overlay
d) for single / single seals with a scatter coat, the scatter coat aggregate shall be applied on the
same day, and
e) for seals with multiple layers of binder and/or aggregate (e.g. double/double seals), the period
shall not exceed one day."
MRTS11,12.1,General,26,27,"The Contractor shall spray the bituminous material in a uniform manner and in a way which promotes
adhesion of the material to the pavement surface and to the cover aggregate, in accordance with
Clauses 12.2 to 12.9 inclusive.
The sprayer shall maintain a constant road speed throughout the length of each sprayer run (except
where permitted by an approved Construction Procedure for achieving a specified variable application
rate).
The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps to prevent:
a) wash-off of bituminous material used to prime pavement surfaces (such as not priming
pavement surfaces immediately prior to rainfall), and
b) environmental harm that may result from the wash-off of this material.
The Contractor shall notify the Administrator as soon as practicable upon becoming aware of any
wash-off of bituminous material used to prime pavement surfaces. Any adverse environmental impacts
such as contamination of land and waterways caused by the wash-off of bituminous material used to
prime pavement surfaces shall be made good by the Contractor to the satisfaction of the
Administrator."

Spray Rate is applied uniformly across the joint.
Spraying on each spray run shall start on a protective strip of heavy paper, with a minimum mass of
120 g/m² and a minimum width of 500 mm. The paper shall be laid across the pavement surface for
the full width of the spray run and shall be held securely in place.
The sprayer shall commence moving at a sufficient distance in advance of the protective strip to
ensure that the road speed for correct application is attained prior to the commencement of spraying.
The spraying for each spray run shall terminate on a protective strip of paper as specified above.
After spraying, the protective strips of paper shall be removed ensuring no excess bituminous material
is deposited on the pavement surface. The Contractor shall dispose of the strips of paper at the end of
each day’s operation in accordance with the waste management requirements of
MRS51 Environmental Management."
MRTS11,12.4,Spraybar nozzles,27,28,"The spraybar nozzles used shall be appropriate for each spray run and shall comply with the
Queensland Sprayer Certificate for the sprayer. Substitution with other nozzle types and sizes is not
permitted. Witness Point 5
Any nozzles that are damaged or become unduly worn or defective shall be replaced by new nozzles
of the same type and size. A sufficient number of nozzles for this purpose shall be available on site at
all times.
The type and positioning of nozzles on the spraybar shall be compatible with the nature of the binder
to be sprayed and its application rate.
Austroads/AfPA PWT33-14 – Sprayed Sealing – Selection of Spraying Nozzles provides guidance
on the appropriate selection of nozzles for sprayed sealing.

not be possible to achieve a satisfactory fan pattern with A18 nozzles (refer Clause 12.6). In these
situations, the use of a sprayer that has been calibrated with B36 nozzles may be required to
achieve a satisfactory fan pattern and to avoid blockages.
Where either blockages or partial blockages of nozzle(s) occur, spraying shall cease immediately. If
the blockage is due to the condition of the binder being sprayed, the condition shall be rectified
sufficiently to avoid future blockages."
MRTS11,12.5,Spraying temperature,28,29,"The acceptable temperature range for spraying bituminous material is listed in Table 12.5. Spraying of
bituminous material shall not occur below the relevant minimum temperature nor heated on site above
the relevant maximum temperature in Table 12.5. However, when cutback bitumen is delivered to the
Works above the maximum temperature indicated in Table 12.5, spraying is permitted within the
temperature range of the minimum given in Table 12.5 and the delivered temperature provided no
further heating occurs. Any binder delivered to site at a temperature above 200ºC shall be rejected.

MRTS11,12.6,Faults during spraying,29,30,"Spraying shall cease immediately if:
• any fault develops in the spraying equipment or operation and shall not recommence until the
fault has been rectified, or
• the bituminous material is not being uniformly applied (e.g. ""tram-tracking"" or a blocked jet in
the spray bar).
Spraying shall not recommence until the cause of the non-uniform binder application has been
rectified.
Achieving a uniform application of binder is critical to maximising the life of a sprayed seal. The
impact of non-uniform binder application can lead to premature flushing or aggregate loss from a
sprayed seal and will not always become apparent during the first 12 months after application. The
uniformity of binder application can be assessed visually at the time of application and examples of
acceptable, marginal, and unacceptable binder uniformity are provided below.
Acceptable binder uniformity Marginal binder uniformity Unacceptable binder

MRTS11,12.7,Cutting back binder,30,30,"The first application of binder in a geotextile reinforced seal or any secondary treatments or
retreatments placed immediately below a layer of asphalt shall not be cut back unless otherwise
specified in Clause 6.6 of Annexure MRTS11.1 or approved by the Administrator.
Notwithstanding the requirements of Clause 6.6 of Annexure MRTS11.1, secondary treatment or
retreatments placed immediately below asphalt should not be cut by more than the addition of"
MRTS11,2.0,parts of cutter oil by volume.,30,31,"Assessment of pavement temperatures shall take into account the cooler condition inherent in shaded
areas of pavement.
Where the road pavement and/or temperature is such that a temporary reduction in binder viscosity is
necessary to enhance initial adhesion between the binder and the cover aggregate, cutter oil shall be
added to the binder for initial seals, secondary treatments and retreatments. The amount of cutter oil
to be used shall be determined by the Seal Designer’s Delegate and be appropriate to:
a) achieve a strong bond between the binder and the cover aggregate, and
b) avoid stripping or flushing / bleeding of the seal or overlying asphalt during the first year of
operation or the defects liability period, whichever is the longer.
The binder must have a sufficiently low viscosity at the time of sealing to achieve adequate initial
wetting of the aggregate. Where the temperature of the binder is too low to achieve this viscosity, it
may be necessary to cut back the binder to reduce its viscosity.
Cutting practice varies considerably across Queensland due to differences in environmental
conditions (both seasonally and geographically).
Table 12.7 can be used as a starting point but is often varied based on local practice.

Note:"
MRTS11,2,Not applicable. Avoid sealing when these weather conditions are present (due to increased risk of,31,32,"stripping).
The amount of cutter oil is typically adjusted as follows:
• reducing the amount of cutter oil by 2 parts when pavement temperatures are rising (for
example, early mornings), and
• increasing the amount of cutter oil by 2 parts when the pavement temperatures are falling
(for example, late afternoon) or pavement temperatures are likely to fall below 5ºC during
the first 24 hours after spraying.
Further reductions in cutter oil rates may be appropriate if:
a) enhanced construction procedures are adopted, and/or
b) sealing commences early in the morning and high pavement temperatures are expected
later in the day, i.e.
i. ≥ 65ºC for S20E binder class
ii. ≥ 55ºC for S15E binder class, and
iii. ≥ 45ºC for all other binder classes.
Cutting practice may also be varied as a result of a number of other factors, which are discussed in
detail in Austroads Technical Report AP-T39-05 Sprayed Seal Cutting Practice.
Additionally, for double / double seal applications, where the second application is applied with little
or no trafficking between applications, the proportion of cutter oil in the first application should be
reduced to:
• 0 – 2 parts for all binder classes other than S15R and S15RF, and
• 0 – 4 parts for S15R and S15RF binder classes.
Seals that require the addition of more than 4 parts of cutter oil should be referred to the
Administrator prior to spraying. Use of excessive cutter oil can lead to poor cohesive strength of the
binder and flushing and/or bleeding of the treatment during subsequent warm / hot weather.
Use of insufficient cutter oil can lead to poor wetting of the aggregate and aggregate loss (stripping)
during initial trafficking of the seal.
In addition, use of insufficient cutter oil in initial seals and/or poor pavement surface preparation can
lead to poor bonding of the initial seal and the underlying pavement.
Further information on the relationship between binder temperature and aggregate adhesion can be
found in Austroads Technical Report AP-T344-19 Relationship between Cutter Oil Properties and
Sprayed Seal Performance.
Incorporation of cutter oil into the binder shall be carried out in accordance with Clause 8.3.3. The
cutter oil, without previously being heated, shall be sucked into the hot bitumen in the sprayer. Before
spraying, after the addition of the last component, the Contractor shall circulate the full sprayer load of
cutback bitumen at a rate of at least 1000 litres per minute for a period until the sprayer contents have
been circulated twice.
Prior to each operation, the Seal Designer’s Delegate shall nominate the cutter oil adjustments, which
shall be recorded. Witness Point 6
Experience has shown that inadequate circulation of crumb rubber modified binder following the
addition of cutter oil can result in tramlining of binder when sprayed. It is therefore critical that the
minimum circulation times stated in Clause 8.3.3 are adhered to when spraying crumb rubber
modified binders."
MRTS11,12.8,Spray rate,32,33,"For all applications other than primes, initial seals and surface enrichments using cutback bitumen, the
Estimated Spray Rate, Designed Spray Rate, Adjusted Designed Spray Rate and Actual Spray Rate

modified binder as appropriate.
For primes, initial seals and surface enrichments using cutback bitumen, the Estimated Spray Rate,
Designed Spray Rate, Adjusted Designed Spray Rate and Actual Spray Rate referred to in this
Any spray rates given in Clause 2 of Annexure MRTS11.1 are Estimated Spray Rates.
The Actual Spray Rate shall be within ± 5% of the Adjusted Designed Spray Rate defined in the
nominated seal design as determined in accordance with Clause 6.
To comply with the above requirements, the Contractor shall make adjustments to the operation of the
sprayer to account for the following:
a) the increased volume of the material to be sprayed where the temperature of the material is
higher than 15ºC (Refer to Table 16(a)), and
b) the increased volume of the material to be sprayed where there are other materials to be
added to the binder for the relevant operation (e.g. cutter oil and/or adhesion agent in a
sealing operation)."
MRTS11,12.9,Quantities retained in sprayer tank,33,33,"To ensure a uniform spray rate, each sprayer run shall be programmed so that the bituminous material

Annexure MRTS11.1, shall be used.
On each day of spreading, each spreader shall be tested in accordance with the Field Spread Rate of
Cover Aggregate test (Q711A) and shall comply with the spread rate tolerance requirements of this
clause. The test frequency shall be one test per spreader per day.
Every attempt shall be made to achieve the required spread pattern on the first spreading pass. Bare
or insufficiently covered areas shall be re-treated as soon as possible with a further light spreading run
or by hand spreading. Over spreading or under spreading of the aggregate shall be avoided.
If there is an uneven distribution of cover aggregate, it shall be broomed until it is evenly distributed
with minimum dislodgment of any embedded cover aggregate. Areas of under-spread aggregate shall
be filled in immediately behind the normal spreading operation and these areas shall receive
additional rolling.
Any initial under spreading shall be rectified by a further light spreading of aggregate and brooming
until it is evenly distributed with minimum dislodgement of any embedded cover aggregate.
The amount of aggregate spread shall be calculated from either:
a) the volume used as recorded on the spray sheets, or
b) by using Test Method Q711A.
