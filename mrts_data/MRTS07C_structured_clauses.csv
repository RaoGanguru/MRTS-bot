Table 2. Where indicated in Table 2 of this Technical Specification, a more complete definition is
contained in the referenced clause.
Table 2 – Definition of terms
Term Definition
Actual stabilised layer Achieved stabilised layer thickness as measured from the bottom of
thickness stabilised layer to the top of compacted and trimmed stabilised
layer.
Allowable working time The time measured from the commencement of incorporation (i.e.
mixing) of the secondary stabilising agent into the material to
completion of compaction and trimming.
Available lime index The available calcium oxide for quicklime or available calcium
hydroxide for hydrated lime in accordance with AS 4489.6.1.
Binder Stabilising agents – see definitions below.
Bulking Increase in vertical height during incorporating stabilising agents
into material using a stabiliser. The increased vertical height of the
material is measured from the surface level prior to this
incorporation process – refer Figure 8.6.11.
Curing materials Materials applied to the exposed surfaces of the completed
stabilised layer for curing.
Design depth As specified in the construction drawings and contract documents –
refer Figure 8.6.11.
Expansion Ratio A term used to define the expansion properties of the bitumen. It is
defined as the ratio of the maximum volume of the bitumen in its
foamed state to the volume of bitumen once the foaming has
completely subsided.
Finish surface level Top level of the stabilised layer as specified in the drawings and
contract documents – refer to Figure 8.6.11.
Foamed bitumen Class 170 bitumen which is (temporarily) brought into a foamed
state by the addition of water and foaming agent(s).
Foaming agent A chemical additive added to bitumen to improve its foaming
characteristics.
Term Definition
Half-life A term used to define the expansion properties of the bitumen. It is
defined as the time taken for the foamed bitumen to settle to
one half of the maximum volume of the bitumen in its foamed state.
It is measured from the start of bitumen foaming.
Height of collimation Height of collimation is the elevation of the optical axis of the
telescope at the time of the setup. The line of collimation is the
imaginary line at the elevation.
Hydrated lime Hydrated lime is a granular form of lime consisting primarily of
calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂).
Lower reference level Lower reference level is the finish surface level minus the design
depth. It is the bottom of the stabilised layer as indicated in the
drawings and contract documents – refer Figure 8.6.11.
Moisture ratio The ratio of the insitu moisture content compared to the laboratory
(uncompacted) (MRᵤ) optimum moisture content expressed as a percentage for
uncompacted materials.
Primary stabilising agent See ‘foamed bitumen’.
Principal Contractor The person or entity who is bound to execute the work under the
Contract.
Quicklime Quicklime is a granular form of lime consisting primarily of calcium
oxide (CaO). Quicklime hydrates rapidly in the presence of water.
Secondary stabilising agent Hydrated lime, slaked quicklime, or hydrated lime / fly ash blend
included in the stabilisation process to improve the dispersion of the
foamed bitumen and increase the early strength of the stabilised
material.
Slaking The addition of water to quicklime (the purpose is to fully hydrate
the quicklime).
Spot check Inspecting quicklime after slaking process, to identify that all
quicklime is completely slaked.
Stabiliser A single-rotor mix-in-place plant of a type (i.e. plant that mixes
insitu) specifically designed for the dual task of reclamation and
stabilisation work.

stabiliser hooked-up to a fully laden water truck shall be used to pulverise the material to be stabilised.
The pulverisation pass shall be undertaken to a depth that is 50 mm less than the design depth
(50 mm above the lower reference level). Witness Point 3
Preliminary pulverisation shall occur:
a) after the removal and replacement of material identified as material not suitable for
stabilisation
b) prior to the addition of shape correction material, and
c) prior to the application or addition of either the bituminous or secondary stabilising agents.
The pulverisation pass shall be undertaken with the incorporation of moisture from the water truck
hooked-up to the stabiliser.
The incorporation of moisture during the pulverisation pass allows the insitu materials to be pre-
conditioned (in particular, those insitu materials with higher water absorptions).
Typically, 0.2-0.5% moisture rate through the stabiliser for the pulverisation pass.
Where the insitu materials has a relatively higher moisture content at the time of insitu stabilising,
the addition of moisture during the pulverisation pass may not be required to pre-condition the
materials.
Any additional patches identified during preliminary pulverisation as material not suitable for
stabilisation and accepted by the Administrator as being material not suitable for stabilisation shall be
removed and replaced as specified in Clause 8.6.1.
Any particle or conglomeration with a dimension greater than 75 mm along any axis shall be removed
from the pulverised material and the voids made good prior to stabilisation. Voids shall be made good

waterproof and watertight. Equipment used to transfer the secondary stabilising agent shall also be
waterproof during the transfer process. All such equipment shall be emptied, cleaned and dried prior
to the introduction of each type of secondary stabilising agent to be used in the stabilisation works.
Where a stabiliser with a calibrated integrated spreader is nominated (refer to Clause 5 of
Annexure MRTS07C.1), the secondary stabilising agent shall be incorporated into the pavement
directly using this device. In this case, quicklime shall not be used as the secondary stabilising agent.
Where a stabiliser with a calibrated integrated spreader is not nominated (refer to Clause 5 of
Annexure MRTS07C.1), the secondary stabilising agent shall be uniformly spread over the insitu

unit area, kg/m²).
The maximum amount of secondary stabilising agent to be spread in one pass shall be 10 kg/m² to
avoid wastage. Spread rates greater than 10 kg/m² are generally not recommended. However, a
maximum spread rate of 12 kg/m may be considered by the Administrator provided a successful field
trial is carried out. If excessive wastage is seen, a maximum spread rate of 10 kg/m² shall be adopted.
The number of passes shall be calculated to comply with this requirement.
Traffic shall be stopped during spreading of secondary stabilising agent. If wind direction is such that
airborne secondary agent impeding through traffic.
At the start of each individual spreading run, the surface spread rate of the secondary stabilising agent
shall be determined using the surface spread rate test method Q719. The surface spread rate test
shall be carried out within a distance of 35 m from the start of each individual spreading run. After the
purpose-built calibrated spreader / integrated spreader has spread over the mat or tray(s), the
spreader shall be halted, the actual spread rate measured, and this result compared with allowable
tolerances specified in Clause 8.7.2.3. If the spread rate result is within the allowable tolerance, the
spreader shall be allowed to complete the run. If the spread rate result is outside the allowable
tolerance, additional surface spread rate tests shall be repeated in 35 m intervals until the measured
surface spread rate result is within the tolerance stated in Clause 8.7.2.3. The Contractor shall
undertake corrective action in the area which has non-conforming surface spread rates.

Subcontractor. The Stabilising Subcontractor shall be responsible for the provision of water / water
carts / operators and associated plant / operators for the purpose of slacking quicklime. This is to
ensure the slaking procedures, plant and water is adequate for the purpose of slaking quicklime in
accordance with this clause.
The equivalent calcium oxide content of quicklime (available lime index) shall not be less than 80%.
Where quicklime is used as the secondary stabilising agent, it shall be spread (refer to Clause 8.6.6)
and fully slaked prior to incorporation into the material(s) to be stabilised. There shall be no residual
quicklime after slaking.
Quicklime shall be slaked with sufficient water to allow complete hydration such that the material
remains friable after slaking and no further exothermic reaction occurs when additional water is added
to the lime.
All through traffic shall be stopped during slaking operations.
Quicklime and/or lime slurry formed from the slaking process, shall be evenly placed and contained
within the stabilising area at the required spread rate. Where displacement of quicklime and/or lime
slurry outside the stabilising area has occurred, corrective action shall be undertaken by the
Contractor prior to commencement of the incorporation. The Contractor shall ensure that no quicklime
and/or lime slurry runs into the adjacent table drain or watercourse during the spreading and slaking
operations.
The slaked quicklime shall be spot checked with a temperature probe and a shovel, to ensure that no
pockets of unslaked quicklime remain (refer to Figure 8.6.7). Where excessive amounts of quicklime is
present (for example, due to poor distribution), additional slaking shall be carried out to ensure
complete hydration prior to the incorporation. Where an impervious thin layer (or crust) forms on the
top of the quicklime making it difficult for additional water to penetrate for the slaking process, the
Contractor shall open up the crust in a safe manner (with proper personal protective equipment) so
further water can access the unslaked quicklime beneath.
The results of the spot checks performed on the slaked quicklime, shall be included in the Contractor’s
quality records (refer to Clause 9.6). The frequency of the spot check testing shall be as per
Clause 5.4. Hold Point 6

Process of spot check for slaking:
1. remove the 'crust' formed on the top of quicklime after the initial slaking
2. insert temperature probe to cover the full depth of quicklime being slaked
3. add water to the area surrounding the temperature probe (water bottle suggested), and
4. note for any rise in temperature and steam.
If increase in the temperature (and steam), additional slaking is required and steps 1 to 4 above
should be repeated, until no temperature rise and further steaming occurs (exothermic reaction)."
MRTS07C,8.6.8.1,General,23,24,"The maximum allowable time between spreading the secondary stabilising agent and incorporation
into the insitu material shall be as stated in Clause 10 of Annexure MRTS07C.1. Where no such time
is stated in the Annexure, the maximum time between spreading and mixing shall be 60 minutes.
Incorporation of the secondary stabilising agent shall be achieved using a stabiliser hooked-up to a
fully laden water truck and shall occur before the incorporation of the bituminous stabilising agent. The
exact location at the start and end of each of the stabilisation runs shall be marked out.
Single pass secondary stabilising agent incorporation (refer to Clause 8.4):
1. Spread and mix the maximum allowable secondary stabilising agent for a single pass as per
Clause 8.6.6 with the addition of water by means of stabiliser to achieve 55% – 75% MRᵤ. The
secondary stabilising agent incorporation depth shall be 50 mm less than design depth

vibration (refer to Figure 8.6.11 and Table 8.6.19) and shaped prior to foamed bitumen pass
by using a grader (refer to Clause 8.6.9.2).
2. Where the secondary stabilising agent is lime, not more than four hours after the secondary
stabilising agent is incorporated into the pavement material, the bituminous stabilising agent
shall be mixed into the pavement material with one pass of the stabiliser to the full target
depth of stabilisation to achieve lower reference level (refer to Figure 8.6.11 and
Clause 8.6.9.2).
Two pass secondary stabilising agent incorporation (refer to Clause 8.4):
1. Both incorporation passes of the secondary stabilising agent shall be undertaken with the
incorporation of moisture from the water truck hooked-up to the stabiliser. Spread and mix the
first pass at a rate of up to half the required rate of the secondary stabilising agent with the
addition of water. The first incorporation pass shall be to a depth of 50 mm less than design
depth (50 mm above the lower reference level) and compacted with smooth drum roller with
vibration (refer to Figure 8.6.11 and Table 8.6.19).
2. Spread and mix remaining balance of the required secondary stabilising agent with the
addition of water by means of stabiliser to achieve 55–75% MRᵤ. Through all incorporation
passes, the Contractor shall not exceed 55-75% MRᵤ. The secondary stabilising agent
incorporation depth shall again be 50 mm less than design depth (50 mm above the lower
reference level) and compacted with a smooth drum roller with vibration (refer to Figure 8.6.11
and Table 8.6.19) and shaped prior to final foamed bitumen pass using a grader (refer
Clause 8.6.9.2).
The incorporation of moisture together with the secondary stabilising agent allows the insitu
materials to be pre-conditioned (in particular, those insitu materials with higher water absorptions).

After each spreading run, and before any other spreading run, secondary stabilising agent shall be
incorporated as specified in Clauses 8.6.7, 8.6.8, 8.6.9, 8.6.10 and 8.6.11. Further shaping, trimming
and/or compaction as required (refer to Clauses 8.6.4, 8.6.12, 8.6.13, and 8.6.14) shall be completed
before each spreading run.
The Contractor shall ensure that no excess secondary stabilising agent is spilt into the adjoining
section during the spreading and incorporation pass(es). This shall be achieved by:
a) ensuring the stabiliser slows down as it approaches the limit of the section, and
b) any excess secondary stabilising agent which is spilt into the adjoining section is spread by
the grader back into the section which is currently being stabilised."
MRTS07C,8.6.8.2,Compaction after incorporation of the secondary stabilising agent,24,24,"Adequate compaction shall be completed after each application of secondary stabilising agent has

compacted to eliminate the height differential between the bulked stabilised material, and any wheel
ruts left by the stabiliser. This may be achieved with at least two passes of a vibrating roller.
After initial compaction, and before final compaction commences, the surface shall be trimmed to
approximately the alignment, heights and shapes specified in the Contract for the completed work and
any depressions shall be filled with additional material stabilised with both stabilising agents that is
mixed and placed within its allowable working time.
For layer thicknesses 200 – 325 mm which are being compacted using a pad foot roller (refer to
Clause 8.6.20), pad foot marks shall be removed to prevent differential compaction and the pad foot
marks reflecting to the surface. The Contractor shall ensure that no marks caused by a pad foot roller
shall remain on the surface. A minimum cut to -100 mm from the Finished Surface Level (FSL) of the
stabilised layer is required to completely remove the influence of pad foot marks and not create a thin
false layer when the stabilised material is reinstated.
Removing (or cutting out) of the pad foot or marks can be undertaken using a grader or stabiliser.
In both cases, a minimum cut to -100 mm from the Finished Surface Level (FSL) of the stabilised
layer is required.
Where a grader is used to remove the pad foot marks, the stabilised material shall not be wasted.
Once the pad foot marks have been completely removed, the stabilised material can be reinstated
to allow the completion of compaction and trimming.
Where a stabiliser is used to remove the pad foot marks, the upper 'loose' stabilised materials can
be compacted and trimmed in place to complete the stabilised layer. The stabiliser's tyre tread
marks (or ruts) must be removed to prevent differential compaction and the tyre tread marks
reflecting to the surface. A sufficiently deep cut with the grader is required to completely remove the
influence of the tyre tread marks and not create a thin false layer when the stabilised material is
reinstated.
For layer thicknesses < 200mm which are being compacted using smooth drum and multi-tyre rollers
(refer to Clause 8.6.20), removal of pad foot marks is not required. However, the stabiliser's tyre tread
marks (or ruts) shall be removed to prevent differential compaction and the tyre tread marks reflecting
to the surface. The Contractor shall ensure that no marks caused by the stabiliser's tyre tread marks
remain on the surface. A sufficiently deep cut with the grader is required to completely remove the
influence of the tyre tread marks and not create a thin false layer when the stabilised material is
reinstated.
Final compaction and trimming of all materials shall be completed within the allowable working time of
each material (refer to Clause 8.4).
Compaction shall be undertaken on the single layer of stabilised material. Compaction shall be
achieved for the full thickness of the single stabilised layer. The stabilised layer shall be compacted to
the standard stated in Clause 8.7.4.
When finishing compaction using the vibrating smooth drum roller, adequate care and attention
must be undertaken to avoid “over-compacting” the stabilised layer (also commonly referred to a
“de-compacting” or “shattering”). Over-compaction can commonly occur when the smooth drum
roller is operated on high amplitude vibration mode.
To avoid over-compaction and damaging the stabilised layer’s surface, typical best practise is low
amplitude vibration mode for the forward direction, and static (or no vibration) for the backwards
direction."

Figure 8.6.15.2 – Typical construction process
When constructing a longitudinal joint in accordance with this clause and Figure 8.6.15.2, the
Contractor must ensure that the final bitumen incorporation pass encompasses the entire area
where the secondary stabilising agent has been spread and mixed.
To achieve this, the Contractor may consider adopting the following process:
• Mix the secondary stabilising agent 150 mm offset from the longitudinal joint location which
is commonly the crown and/or centreline as shown in Figure 8.6.15.2 (refer to Step 2 in
Figure 8.6.15.2).
• Complete the final bitumen incorporation pass ensuring the stabiliser cuts into the adjoining
stabilised materials thus forming a sufficient overlap (refer to Step 3 in Figure 8.6.15.2)."
MRTS07C,8.6.15.3,Transverse joints,31,31,"For transverse joints that are not fresh, the adjoining stabilised section shall be remixed using a
stabiliser by the greater of 1.5 m or the length ordered by the Administrator.
Where there is more than one layer of insitu stabilised material, the transverse joints of each layer
shall be offset from the underlying layer’s joint by a minimum distance of 150 mm."
MRTS07C,8.6.16,Surface finish,31,31,"The finished surface of any stabilised pavement layer shall:
• be hard and homogenous in appearance
• not be friable when subject to mechanical brooming
• not have any loose, segregated or contaminated areas
• have the course particles slightly exposed
• not be affected by delamination
• not have any cracking
• not show signs of water pumping, and
• not visibly deflect under load when proof rolled in accordance with Clause 9.9.
It is intended that these requirements apply to the condition of the pavement surface immediately
prior to application of the surfacing treatment / layer. The Contractor may need to undertake
additional controls beyond the basic construction activities (compaction, trimming and so on) to
ensure these requirements are satisfied.
Where a stabilised pavement layer is required to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment,
particular attention needs to be given to the surface finish of the stabilised pavement layer in order
to ensure good adhesion.
Inadequate curing can lead to an excessively dusty surface, which may be difficult to prepare. To
address this, curing should be undertaken in accordance with Clause 8.6.17 to ensure the
pavement remains continuously damp.
Where the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with another pavement layer (that is, not bitumen
seal and/or asphalt), consideration needs to be given on how to adequately prepare the surface to
maximise the bond between the pavement layers.
If the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with another insitu stabilised layer, it is recommended
that the overlying layer be insitu stabilised to a depth which will ‘tuck in’ to the underlying layer. The
‘tuck in’ details shall be provided in the Contract documents.
If the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with a plant-mixed stabilised or granular layer, it is
recommended that the finished surface be hard-cut and/or broomed to produce a roughly textured
surface before placing the next layer."
MRTS07C,8.6.17,Curing,32,32,"A curing operation shall commence immediately after the completion of compaction. Curing operation
shall be carried out with extreme care to avoid any damage to the stabilised layer.
The stabilised layer shall be cured using water by maintaining the layer surface and edges in a
continuously damp condition, using a uniformly applied fine mist, until the stabilised layer is covered
by an overlying pavement layer or a sprayed bituminous surfacing with cover aggregate is placed as
described in Clause 8.6.19 has been applied.
Water shall be applied in a manner such that slurrying of the surface, pavement instability, pavement
erosion flushing and/or leaching of the stabilising agents are all avoided."
MRTS07C,8.6.18,Maintenance of the stabilised layer,32,32,"The stabilised layer shall be maintained by the Contractor until a bituminous surfacing with a cover
aggregate is applied, or until the stabilised layer is covered by another pavement layer, or until the
Administrator accepts and takes responsibility for that area (whichever is the longer).
The surface of the stabilised layer shall be kept moist, in good order, in good condition and free from
contamination. Construction and other traffic shall not traverse the stabilised layer where damage to
the surface may occur.
No separate or additional payment shall be made for maintenance of the stabilised layer. The cost of
all activities associated with maintenance of the stabilised layer shall be deemed to be incorporated
into the relevant work items for the stabilised layer."
