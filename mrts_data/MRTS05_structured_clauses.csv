MRTS05,1,Introduction,5,5,"This Technical Specification applies to the supply and construction of unbound granular pavements.
Material from natural, quarried and recycled sources, or a combination of these, can all be used.
This Technical Specification shall be read in conjunction with MRTS01 Introduction to Technical
Specifications, MRTS50 Specific Quality System Requirements and other Technical Specifications as
appropriate.
This Technical Specification forms part of the Transport and Main Roads Specifications Manual.
The requirements of this Technical Specification are designed to provide a high probability of a
satisfactory pavement being produced. However, it is acknowledged that alternative or
supplementary requirements specific to local conditions and the known performance of local
materials may be incorporated through project-specific supplementary requirements.
This Technical Specification assumes that the pavement is not excessively exposed to water and
that protective measures are taken to assure this. Where exposure to moisture is expected,
additional controls over and above the requirements of this Technical Specification may be
warranted or the use of bound pavement materials should be considered in the pavement design."

MRTS05,7,Material,13,14,"Unbound pavement materials specified in accordance with this Technical Specification have the
following attributes:
Type 1 – High Standard Granular (HSG)
• A premium unbound granular pavement material, for use in the base course of heavy duty
unbound pavements to produce a hard, durable and uniform material that enables a dense
and homogeneous pavement to be constructed.
• Typically covered with a sprayed bituminous treatment or thin asphalt surfacing.
• Relies principally on the mobilisation of internal frictional forces to resist the applied load.
• Potentially highly permeable. Requires protection from moisture as soon as possible after
construction. Will deteriorate rapidly if the surfacing fails.
• Permeability is reduced by specifying a higher minimum linear shrinkage requirement.
• A high compaction standard specified to provide some reduction in permeability as well as
increased stiffness.
• Type 1 materials typically have a very low unconfined strength. Consequently, a single coat
seal may not provide adequate confinement, particularly under heavy traffic and at least a
double / double polymer modified seal or asphalt surfacing should be applied.
• Must not be subject to traffic without a surfacing and should be subject to traffic only for a
very short period of time, if it is covered by a prime only.
• No direct strength test (CBR) is specified as optimum property limits are specified.
• Because of the extensive range of properties chosen to specify this material and because
optimum property limits have been specified, Type 1 materials provide the highest
probability of obtaining a consistently high-quality pavement material.
• Further information regarding the use of Type 1 (HSG) pavements materials is provided in
TN171 Use of High Standard Granular (HSG) Bases in Heavy Duty Unbound Granular
Pavements.
Type 2 – Standard Material
• A high quality unbound granular pavement material, for use in base, subbase and lower
pavement layers.
• Relies principally on the mobilisation of internal frictional forces and/or cohesion to resist
the applied load.
• If a sprayed bituminous treatment or asphalt surfacing is not provided, consideration should
be given to specifying a higher minimum linear shrinkage requirement.
• To comply with the CBR requirements (where specified), the Contractor may have to apply
more stringent target properties to the material within the limits given in this Technical
Specification.
• Commonly used in wet environments, hence the requirement for a soaked CBR (where
specified) and more stringent durability requirements (compared to Type 3 materials).
• Type 2 material may be produced from either natural, quarried or recycled material.
Type 3 – Standard Material
• Attributes are as per Type 2, except intended for use in relatively dry environments, only
where the pavement equilibrium moisture content is low, hence the requirement for an
unsoaked CBR (where specified). Similarly, only the wet strength and the flakiness index
properties for the coarse component are specified and the fines standards are less
stringent than the values specified for Type 2 materials.
• Type 2 material of the same subtype produced from either natural, quarried or recycled
material may be used where a Type 3 material is specified.
Type 4 – Non-standard material
• Relies principally on cohesion, but may also utilise the mobilisation of internal frictional
forces to resist the applied load.
• The only default property specified for Type 4 materials is unsoaked CBR, to provide a
hierarchy of the respective subtypes.
• To utilise a Type 4 material, the designer must develop the standards and requirements
relevant to the particular material and include these in Annexure MRTS05.1.
• The use of a standard Type 2 or Type 3 material may not be suitable where a Type 4
material has been specified.
Typical applications for each material subtype are given in the Transport and Main Roads
Pavement Design Supplement."
MRTS05,7.1.1,General,14,15,"Type 1 (HSG) material shall be hard, sound, durable and not breakdown in service.
The locations in which Type 1 (HSG) material is to be used, shall be shown in the design
documentation or specified in Clause 2.1 of Annexure MRTS05.1.
When properly constructed, a Type 1 (HSG) base provides a dense, relatively low-permeability
structural layer, with increased durability. The Type 1 (HSG) requirements of this Technical
Specification are based on historically specified Subtype 1.1 materials, modified to help ensure that
this higher standard of pavement is able to be consistently achieved.
The use of Type 1 (HSG) materials in accordance with this Technical Specification has a number of
specific requirements, including:
• material properties as specified in this Clause
• use of specific paving equipment and tighter process controls for adding moisture
• tighter controls on layer thickness and DoS
• texturing of the surface between layers, and
• checking of post-compaction gradings and assessment of compaction using modified
compaction."

† Materials are to be classified into a material group on the basis of the lithology of the major granular component,
except where two or more components each constitute over 30% of the total, then the most stringent properties
of these materials group shall be applied.
‡ If the material does not comply with the specified maximum wet / dry strength variation limits, the wet / dry
strength variation requirement may be waived if the wet strength is at least 60 kN above the relevant specified
minimum value.
* For Adamellite source material only (Acid Igneous Group), the minimum wet strength shall be 115 kN.
Material tests are specified to assess the following properties:
• Wet strength: strength.
• Wet / dry strength variation: indirect measure of durability.
• Degradation factor: indirect measure of durability by measuring the amount of secondary
minerals in the aggregate.
• Crushed particles: indirect measure of aggregate surface roughness that generates internal
friction. This property is particularly important for Type 1 (HSG) materials. For material
manufactured exclusively from crushed quarry products, the Administrator may elect to
waive the requirement to test for this property.
• Flakiness index: measures the amount of aggregate particles that are elongated and/or flat.
‘Flaky’ particles reduce workability and are prone to breakdown during compaction and in
service.
• Water absorption: a complementary test to degradation factor to assess material durability.
Also specified as a way of controlling the amount of moisture that aggregates can absorb
during construction, which may later be released as pore water and lead to DoS issues.
The Administrator should forward any test reports to tmrquarryregistration@tmr.qld.gov.au,
where the water absorption reported is greater than:
− 3.0% for undersaturated glassy basalt
− 4.0% for oversaturated glassy basalt
− 2.0% for all other materials."

Liquid Limit ≤ 25
Linear Shrinkage (%) 1.5 – 3.5
Linear Shrinkage (LS) limits are specified for Type 1 (HSG) materials to control the content of
plastic (that is, clay) materials. In Type 1 (HSG) materials, which are materials designed to carry
load primarily through internal frictional forces (particle interlock), excess clay must be controlled as
this may lead to a potential loss of stability of the material, due to the softening of the clay
component from wetting up of the pavements.
Minimum LS limits are specified to enhance the performance of these unbound pavement materials
by improving workability, providing some degree of cohesion and reducing permeability."
MRTS05,7.1.4,Particle size distribution (grading),17,17,"The particle size distribution requirement is specified in Table 7.1.4(a). The Contractor shall aim to
produce material conforming to the target grading. The maximum and minimum limits define an
acceptable zone of departure from this target grading for any sample taken prior to the construction of

The fines ratio can be related to unbound pavement material performance as follows:

stability."

Where applicable, different requirements have been specified for general materials (which contain
< 70% recycled materials) and recycled material blends (which contain ≥ 70% recycled materials).
For any requirement where no distinction is made between general materials and recycled material
blends, the requirements shall apply to both.
Recycled materials may be used in base layers when:
• the average daily traffic in the design lane in year of opening is less than 500 Equivalent
Standard Axles (ESAs), (the average daily traffic in the design lane in year of opening is given
in Clause 2.2 of Annexure MRTS05.1), and
• an asphalt surfacing is provided over the base.
There are no restrictions to the use of recycled materials in other applications, for example
non-trafficked shoulders, sub-bases, improved layers, or subgrade treatments.
Transport and Main Roads supports the use of recycled materials based on their highest and best
use. The reuse of RAP in asphalt maximises the value of its high quality aggregates and residual
binder.
Where RAP is not suitable for reuse in asphalt (for example, other material has been mixed with it
during removal or handling) this second class material may be recycled by incorporating it into
unbound pavement materials.
The locations in which material of a specific subtype is to be used, shall be shown in the design

MRTS05,12,months prior to its intended incorporation into the Works.,32,33,"A common factor affecting the premature failure of newly constructed unbound granular
pavements, has been the presence of excess moisture within the pavement base prior to the
application of the bituminous surfacing. A DoS above the specified limits can lead to:
• rapid failure including blow-outs and rutting of an unbound pavement layer due to shear
failures
• lifting of the surfacing due to positive pore pressure, and
• embedment of cover aggregate due to the softness of the base."
MRTS05,8.3.4.2,Moisture content during construction,33,33,"The unbound pavement material may have a moisture content greater than that represented by the
relevant DoS limit specified in Clause 8.3.4.1 for the purpose of construction only, provided that the
section of pavement is dried back to meet the requirements of Clause 8.3.4.1 at the time it is covered
by another pavement or surfacing layer.
For Type 1 (HSG) material, water shall only be added to the unbound pavement material via a
controlled and measured process and be uniformly mixed through the material using a pugmill (or
equivalent mechanical process).
Water shall not drain freely from the pavement material during production, handling, transport or
construction.
Sufficient moisture must be added to unbound pavement material to allow adequate lubrication of
the particles to achieve compaction. Generally, unbound materials should be compacted near the
relevant OMC to achieve maximum density; however, materials are often compacted slightly dry
of OMC to reduce the time required to achieve dry back.
Developing optimum moisture content and density graphs for the material can be useful to
characterise the material, indicate sensitivity to moisture content and inform compaction
procedures. However, the required moisture content for field compaction will depend largely on the
conditions onsite and must be chosen to align with the material's characteristics and the
compaction equipment to be used.
Uniformity of moisture content in the material is important, as variations will likely affect
compactability, leading to unsatisfactory variations in density.
Moisture conditioning unbound pavement materials prior to delivery to the roadbed, will assist in
minimising segregation during the spreading stage. However, the type and capacity of the pugmill
will determine the length of the mixing time. Too short a mixing time in the pugmill will result in
uneven moisture content throughout the product and will adversely impact on the ability to readily
achieve the required compaction result."
MRTS05,8.3.5.1,General,34,34,"From when the layer is presented to the Administrator for inspection [refer Hold Point 5], until
immediately prior to covering, the finished surface of any unbound pavement layer shall:
• be hard and homogenous in appearance
• not have any loose, segregated or contaminated areas
• have the coarse particles slightly exposed
• not be affected by delamination
• not show signs of water pumping, and
• not visibly deflect under load when proof rolled in accordance with Clause 9.4.7.
For layers that are to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment, the surface shall have a
maximum ball penetration value that complies with Clause 8.4.7.
As necessary, the Contractor shall trim, lightly water, broom and roll the pavement to achieve the
above finish to the satisfaction of the Administrator."
MRTS05,8.3.5.2,Preparation of Type 1 (HSG) layers prior to placing the next layer,34,34,"Where a Type 1 (HSG) layer is to be overlaid directly with another layer of Type 1 (HSG) material, the
finished surface shall be prepared so that it has a hard-rough surface with a texture depth not less
than 1 mm (when testing in accordance with Test Method AG:PT/T250) without reducing the density of
the layer or compromising the integrity of the surface.
The Contractor will nominate in their Construction Procedure, the proposed methodology to prepare
the pavement. This may be undertaken by hard brooming using a drag broom, however other plant
may be used dependent on the nature of the project and what equipment is available onsite for
other processes.
Unless otherwise approved by the Administrator, the overlying layer of Type 1 (HSG) material must be
constructed within three days of the construction of the underlying layer unless additional time is
required to meet the DoS limit for the underlying layer. Where additional time is needed to dry back
the underlying layer, the overlying layer shall be constructed as soon as the required DoS has been
reached.
All cut back material shall be disposed of in accordance with Clause 10 of MRTS01 Introduction to"
MRTS05,8.3.6,Construction joints between adjacent paving runs,34,35,"To the extent practical, the Contractor shall spread the unbound pavement material in a manner that
minimises the number of joints.
Joints shall be constructed such that the material at the joints comply in all ways with the requirements
of this Technical Specification.
Longitudinal joints must comply with the following requirements unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator:
a) joints shall be offset by a minimum of 150 mm from a joint in the underlying layers, except
where required, otherwise to achieve the design shape (for example to construct a crowned
pavement)
b) joints shall be located away from trafficked wheel paths, and
c) joints in the final (uppermost) layer of unbound pavement bases shall coincide with the final
traffic lane markings and/or line of change in crossfall (for example, crown of the pavement).
Transverse joints must be offset by a minimum of 2.0 m from a joint in any underlying layer, unless
otherwise approved by the Administrator.
The Administrator may approve longitudinal joints in the final (uppermost) layer of the base course
to be constructed away from lane marking where this represents the best outcome to achieve the
pavement design intent. For example, when paving a single lane ramp with wide shoulders, the
Administrator may allow the Contractor to form a single longitudinal joint along the centre of the
ramp, rather than paving the ramp lane between the edge line marking and the subsequently
paving shoulders on either side."
MRTS05,8.3.7,Contractor's responsibilities,35,35,"The Contractor shall maintain each layer so that it complies with all aspects of this Technical
Specification until it has been overlaid with another pavement layer, or surfaced with the final surfacing
and then until the end of the defect liability period or as otherwise required under the Contract."
MRTS05,8.3.8,Dust management,35,35,"Unbound pavement material shall be transported in covered vehicles and delivered with sufficient
moisture to control dust. Materials shall not be worked dry, but rather with sufficient moisture to
minimise dust.
The moisture content required to manage dust will vary from material to material, however, would
generally be less than that required to place and compact the material as a conforming pavement
layer."
MRTS05,8.4.1,Segregation,35,35,"Segregation is the uneven distribution of particle sizes. The construction process shall control
segregation so that the particle size distribution of the unbound pavement material complies with the
particle size distribution requirements in Clause 7 (for the relevant subtype and grading) prior to the
commencement of compaction.
Where there are visible signs of segregation in any lot prior to the commencement of compaction, the
Administrator may direct the area to be tested for conformance with the above requirements."
MRTS05,8.4.2,Post compaction grading of Type 1 (HSG) material,36,36,"For Type 1 (HSG) materials, material breakdown (and segregation) shall be assessed against the

specifically shown on the drawings, the thickness of the base course may be determined in
accordance with Figure 8.4 of the Austroads Guide to Pavement Technology (Part 2: Pavement
Structural Design).
Where unbound pavement materials are used in other applications (for example stabilised pavements)
the compaction requirements of the relevant Technical Specification shall apply.
Where the use of IC Rollers is specified in Clause 3.1.2 of Annexure MRTS05.1, the lot coverage must
comply with the requirements specified in Table 8.4.3(b).
Coverage shall be calculated as:
1. the area of the lot (that is to be incorporated into the Works) which has achieved the minimum
number of roller passes nominated in the Unbound Pavement Construction Procedure, divided
by
2. the total area of the lot that is to be incorporated into the Works.

The intent of this Technical Specification is that all high standard and standard quality unbound
base materials (that is, Type 1 (HSG), Subtypes 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, and 3.2) are to be compacted to
100% modified compaction. This higher standard of compaction has a number or advantages,
including:
1. reduced permeability
2. increased strength of the unbound base, and
3. improved fatigue life of thin asphalt surfacings.
All other unbound materials (that is, Subtypes 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and Type 4) are intended
to be used in lower trafficked applications or in lower pavement layers. Accordingly, these materials
are intended to be compacted to 100% standard compaction in most applications. These materials
may not be suitable for compaction to 100% modified compaction as follows:
a) lower strength materials may be prone to breakdown during compaction. This is particularly
likely where the wet strength is ≤ 90kN, and/or
b) the underlying materials may not provide adequate support for compaction."

complies in all regards with the requirements of this Technical Specification. As a minimum, the
Contractor's testing program shall not be less than that specified in this clause.
The Contractor shall ensure that sufficient, clearly documented construction compliance records are
provided to the Administrator to ensure that traceability of unbound pavement materials is provided
from their source (for example, quarry face) to the constructed pavement.
The Contractor shall not incorporate materials into the work, unless it has demonstrated that the
material complies fully with the requirements of this Technical Specification before delivery of the
material to site. Hold Point 5 Such conformance results shall be no more than 18 months old, unless
otherwise agreed by the Administrator.
When test results are more than six months old, where requested by the Administrator, the Contractor
shall undertake audit testing prior to submitting [refer Hold Point 6] to demonstrate the material still

The requirements for audit testing of stockpiles greater than six months, old would typically involve
undertaken grading, liquid limit and linear shrinkage testing.
Maximum lot sizes, minimum test frequencies and the minimum number of tests required are specified
in Appendix A.
Where testing frequencies are specified as a number of tests per a quantity, the tests should be

Being registered under QRS does not guarantee a quarry's ability to produce conforming material.
Quarries are not required to submit conformance tests directly to QRS during production (however these results may be included in registration renewals
from time to time). For this reason, it is important that all conformance tests specified in Table A2 are provided to the Administrator as part of each
