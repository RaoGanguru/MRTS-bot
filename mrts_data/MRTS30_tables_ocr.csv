 | 1 This table has been developed to assist designers in selecting binders to optimise performance outcomes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | on projects. Mixes may be used outside these parameters and still provide acceptable long-term |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | performance. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | 2 High shear areas include signalised intersections and approaches, roundabouts and approaches, and |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | other areas with very slow moving heavy vehicles. For bus stops, busways and bus-only lanes, specialist |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | advice should be sought from the Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings). |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | 3 M1000 typically has a shorter oxidation life than C320 and A15E binders. More frequent resurfacing |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | should be anticipated where M1000 binder is used in surfacing layers. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | 4 A15E binder is typically used in situations where enhanced deformation and/or fatigue resistance is |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 | desired. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |"

 | The requirements of this Technical Specification represent the minimum standards that generally | 
 | apply to asphalt incorporated into the department’s projects. However, in some regional localities, | 
 | the use of asphalt fully conforming with the requirements of this Technical Specification may be | 
 | prohibitively expensive, particularly if conforming constituent materials are not locally available. | 
 | There may also be situations where the department wishes to trial the use of nonstandard | 
 | constituent materials in asphalt mixes that are innovative in nature and their use aligns with other | 
 | strategic objectives of the department (such as increasing the use of recycled materials). | 
 | The need for project specific variations to enable the use of constituent materials that are | 
 | nonstandard or that do not conform with the default requirements should be endorsed by the | 
 | Principal during the preconstruction phase of the project and the requirements nominated in the | 
 | Contract to enable competitive tendering for the Works. | 
 | Given that these mix designs contain nonconforming or nonstandard materials, they may be | 
 | registered, at the discretion of the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar, as nonconforming or nonstandard | 
 | mix designs. However, the Asphalt Mix Design Registrar may require additional testing to be | 
 | carried out prior to registration being granted. ‘Conditions of use’ associated with the | 
 | implementation and use of these mix designs on Transport and Main Roads projects may also be | 
 | nominated on the Asphalt Mix Design Register. | 
 | An engineering risk assessment should be undertaken during the preconstruction phase of a | 
 | project to evaluate whether a departure from the default requirements or the use of nonstandard | 
 | constituent materials is appropriate. The designer for the Works is advised to seek advice from the | 
 | Principal Engineer (Asphalt and Surfacings) when undertaking these assessments. These | 
 | assessments should consider as a minimum, the following: |

 | More sustainable asphalt and lower emissions | 
 | This Technical Specification requires asphalt mixes to contain a warm mix asphalt additive to enable | 
 | these mixes to be produced and compacted at a lower temperature than has historically been required | 
 | (in previous versions of this Technical Specification). This temperature reduction should help lower | 
 | emissions and improve sustainability outcomes while still achieving a conforming product. | 
 | Implementation of these new requirements will require adjustment to manufacturing, transport and | 
 | construction processes when compared to hot mix asphalt. However, there may be cases where | 
 | conformance with the insitu air voids requirements could be difficult to achieve due to the lower | 
 | maximum production temperature limits. These situations would typically be associated with placing | 
 | asphalt during cold weather (e.g., when the air temperature or pavement surface temperature is less | 
 | than 20°C for 7 mm mixes, 15°C for 10 mm mixes, 10°C for 14 mm mixes and 5°C for 20 mm mixes), | 
 | or when the work involves long haul distances to site (e.g., haul time between the asphalt plant and a | 
 | remote job site exceeds 3 hours). If construction needs to proceed in these situations, the | 
 | Administrator may approve an increase to the maximum production temperature (to 175°C for mixes | 
 | containing a bitumen binder and 185°C for mixes containing a polymer modified binder) to help reduce | 
 | the risk of nonconforming (that is, high) insitu air voids. Preferably such decisions and the process for | 
 | making them would be discussed and confirmed at a contract pre-start meeting (that includes the | 
 | prequalified asphalt contractor) or a contract meeting (that includes the prequalified asphalt contractor) | 
 | held well in advance of the asphalt works starting. |

 | For dense graded asphalt and stone mastic asphalt, each asphalt mix design has its own optimal |

 | Technical Specification. However, the objective of the asphalt placement and compaction process | 
 | is to achieve an asphalt layer that is relatively uniform in thickness and density. Achieving a | 
 | relatively uniform density requires the asphalt to be placed and compacted at relatively uniform | 
 | temperatures. Intermittent supply of asphalt to the paver is a common cause for stop / start paving | 
 | and significant temperature variation at the commencement of rolling. Such variations should be | 
 | avoided wherever possible, as they often lead to variation in density (air voids) and premature | 
 | distress. Areas may be sub-lotted and tested separately to confirm they comply with the | 
 | specification requirements for air voids. | 
 | AP-PWT13 - Temperature Characteristics of Binders in Asphalt provides guidance on minimum | 
 | temperatures for effective compaction of asphalt mixes. |

 | Coating provides guidance on asphalt tack coating. | 
 | The time lapse between applying the tack coat and laying the subsequent asphalt layer will vary | 
 | depending on the climatic conditions and the grade of bituminous emulsion being used. | 
 | Application rates towards the low end of the specified range (0.10 to 0.30 L/m²) should be adopted | 
 | when placing asphalt over relatively new asphalt layers. Application rates that are towards the | 
 | higher end of this range should be used when placing asphalt over oxidised and/or milled surfaces. | 
 | Asphalt layers may be lightly trafficked for construction purposes without the need for tack coating. | 
 | This would typically be limited to trafficking with the paving train and associated equipment such as | 
 | traffic control and other service vehicles provided the asphalt surface remains free of any material | 
 | or contamination that may compromise bonding to the underlying layer. Asphalt layers that are |

 | joints are not usually tested for insitu air voids unless the Administrator suspects, based on | 
 | surveillance and/or the visual appearance of the joints, the specified requirements have not been | 
 | achieved. Typically, joint compaction would be tested across joints where both adjoining sections of |

 | being tested is adjacent to asphalt not placed under the same contract. |

 | Tolerances that would apply for a 300 mm asphalt pavement consisting of a 50 mm thick AC14H | 
 | layer (surfacing course) placed to thickness, a 50 mm thick AC14H layer (intermediate course) | 
 | placed to levels and 2 x 100 mm thick AC20H layers (base course) placed to levels are as follows: | 
 | • AC14H surfacing course: | 
 | Thickness: o | 
 |  Average: ± 4 mm | 
 |  Individual locations: ± 7 mm | 
 | • AC14H intermediate course: | 
 | Levels: Individual locations: ± 10 mm o | 
 | • AC20H base course: | 
 | Upper layer: o | 
 |  Levels: Individual locations: ± 10 mm | 
 | Lower layer: o | 
 |  Not specified. However, it is expected that Contractors will adopt an | 
 | appropriate standard of level control to achieve the level requirements | 
 | specified for the top of base course. | 
 | For some asphalt inlay projects where the work will match existing surface levels, the default | 
 | requirements for level control may not be appropriate. When undertaking a 130 mm thick asphalt | 
 | inlay project consisting of a 50 mm thick AC14H layer (surfacing course) and an 80 mm thick | 
 | AC20H layer (intermediate course), the typical vertical control requirements are as follows: | 
 | • Cold mill the existing pavement to a nominated depth (to be specified elsewhere in the | 
 | contract) | 
 | • AC14H surfacing course: | 
 | Levels: o | 
 |  Match the surrounding pavement surface | 
 | • AC20H intermediate course: | 
 | Thickness: o | 
 |  Average: ± 5 mm |
