wastage. The number of passes shall be calculated to comply with this requirement.
Traffic shall be stopped during spreading of stabilising agent if wind direction is such that airborne
cementitious blends are impeding through traffic.
At the start of each individual spreading run, the surface spread rate of the stabilising agent shall be
determined using the surface spread rate Test Method Q719. The surface spread rate test shall be
carried out within a distance of 35 m from the start of each individual spreading run. After the purpose-
built calibrated spreader / integrated spreader has spread over the mat or tray/s, the spreader shall be
halted, the actual spread rate measured, and this result compared with allowable tolerances specified
in Clause 8.7.2.3. If the spread rate result is within the allowable tolerance, the spreader shall be
allowed to complete the run. If the spread rate result is outside the allowable tolerance, additional
surface spread rate tests shall be repeated in 35 m intervals until the measured surface spread rate
result is within the tolerance stated in Clause 8.7.2.3. The Contractor shall undertake corrective action
in the area which has nonconforming surface spread rates. Witness Point 5
Additional surface spread rate tests at other locations (for example middle and/or end of a run) shall
be conducted upon the request of the Administrator.

MRTS07B,8.6.8.1,General,19,19,"Incorporation of the stabilising agent shall be achieved using the stabiliser. The stabiliser shall be
hooked-up to a fully laden water truck to allow for the incorporation of moisture.
The incorporation of moisture together with the stabilising agent allows the insitu materials to be
pre-conditioned (in particular, those insitu materials with higher water absorptions).
Through the incorporation pass(es), the Contractor should target incorporating approximately 50%
of the required total moisture needed to achieve the specified moisture ratio (refer to Clause 8.7.3).
Where the insitu materials has a relatively higher moisture content at the time of insitu stabilising,
the addition of moisture during the incorporation pass(es) may not be required to pre-condition the
materials.
The Contractor shall ensure that no excess stabilising agent is spilt into the adjoining section during
the spreading and incorporation passes. This shall be achieved by:
a) ensuring the stabiliser slows down as it approaches the limit of the section, and
b) any excess stabilising agent which is spilt into the adjoining section is spread by the grader back
into the section which is currently being stabilised."

(refer to Clause 8.6.17) to achieve the compaction stated in Clause 8.7.4.
For layer thicknesses 200 – 300 mm which are being compacted using a pad foot roller (refer to
Clause 8.6.17), pad foot marks shall be removed to prevent differential compaction and the pad foot
marks reflecting to the surface. The contractor shall ensure that no marks caused by a pad foot roller
remain on the surface. A minimum cut to -100 mm from the Finished Surface Level (FSL) of the
stabilised layer is required to completely remove the influence of the pad foot marks and not create a
thin false layer when the stabilised material is reinstated.
Removing (or cutting out) of the pad foot marks can be undertaken using a grader or stabiliser.
In both cases, a minimum cut to -100 mm from the Finished Surface Level (FSL) of the stabilised
layer is required.
Where a grader is used to remove the pad foot marks, the stabilised material shall not be wasted.
Once the pad foot marks have been completely removed, the stabilised material can be reinstated
to allow the completion of compaction and trimming.
Where a stabiliser is used to remove the pad foot marks, the upper 'loose' stabilised materials can
be compacted and trimmed in place to complete the stabilised layer. The stabiliser's tyre tread
marks (or ruts) must be removed to prevent differential compaction and the tyre tread marks
reflecting to the surface. A sufficiently deep cut with the grader is required to completely remove the
influence of the tyre tread marks and not create a thin false layer when the stabilised material is
reinstated.
For layer thicknesses < 200 mm which are being compacted using smooth drum and multi-tyre rollers
(refer to Clause 8.6.17), removal of pad foot marks is not required. However, the stabiliser's tyre tread
marks (or ruts) shall be removed to prevent differential compaction and the tyre tread marks reflecting
to the surface. The Contractor shall ensure that no marks caused by the stabiliser's tyre tread marks
remain on the surface. A sufficiently deep cut with the grader is required to completely remove the
influence of the tyre tread marks and not create a thin false layer when the stabilised material is
reinstated.
Initial shaping of the stabilised surface shall be carried out after the stabilised layer has been
compacted.
The trimmed surface shall be free from loose pockets, holes, bumps and lenses of materials. The
identified depressions shall be filled with additional stabilised material that is mixed and placed within
its allowable working time as specified in Clause 8.4.
No marks caused by any roller or stabilisation plant shall be left on the surface of the stabilised layer.
All final trimming shall involve cutting to waste. All material cut to waste shall be disposed of in
accordance with Clause 10 of MRTS01 Introduction to Technical Specifications. No separate payment
shall be made for the disposal of material cut to waste. The cost of all activities associated with the
disposal of material cut to waste shall be deemed to be incorporated into the relevant work items.
Compaction and trimming (excluding static multi-tyre rolling) shall be completed within the allowable
working time as specified in Clause 8.4.
When finishing compaction using the vibrating smooth drum roller, adequate care and attention
must be undertaken to avoid “over-compacting” the stabilised layer (also commonly referred to a
“de-compacting” or “shattering”). Over-compaction can commonly occur when the smooth drum
roller is operated on high amplitude vibration mode.
To avoid over-compaction and damaging the stabilised layer’s surface, typical best practise is low
amplitude vibration mode for the forward direction, and static (or no vibration) for the backwards
direction."
MRTS07B,8.6.12.1,General,23,23,"Joints shall be constructed such that the material at the joints complies with the requirements of this
A construction joint (longitudinal or transverse) shall be deemed fresh when the material on each side
of the joint has been stabilised, placed and compacted within the allowable working time (refer to
Clause 8.4) of the stabilised material constructed first."
MRTS07B,8.6.12.2,Longitudinal joints,23,25,"Longitudinal joints shall not be located in the through traffic wheel paths.
Where a fresh longitudinal joint between adjacent runs is to be compacted, the outside 300 mm of
material from the first run shall be left uncompacted until the adjacent material is ready for compaction.
The joint shall be water cured during this period. When the fresh joint is compacted the roller shall be
partially supported on the portion of the first run that has been previously compacted.
For longitudinal joints that are not fresh, to ensure complete stabilisation across the full width of the
pavement, the minimum distance for cutting back / overlapping into previously stabilised material shall
be the greater of 100 mm or the distance to a point where the stabilised material complies with this
The overlap at a change of crossfall or crown shall be carefully considered to comply with the
longitudinal joint requirements of this clause and Clause 8.7.5.
Where there is more than one layer of insitu stabilised material, the formation of the longitudinal
joint at the crown needs to be considered. Refer to MRTS07A Insitu Stabilised Subgrades using
Quicklime or Hydrated Lime, Figure 8.6.7.2 – Typical construction process for guidance.
No separate or additional payment shall be made for the disposal of material cut to waste. The cost of
all activities associated with the disposal of material cut to waste shall be deemed to be incorporated
into the relevant work items.
Figure 8.6.12.2 – Typical construction process
When constructing a longitudinal joint in accordance with this clause and Figure 8.6.12.2, the
Contractor must ensure that the final moisture incorporation pass encompasses the entire area
where the stabilising agent has been spread and mixed.
To achieve this, the Contractor may consider adopting the following process:
• Spread the mix the stabilising agent 150 mm offset from the longitudinal joint location which
is commonly the crown and/or centreline as shown in Figure 8.6.12.2 (refer to Step 2 in
Figure 8.6.12.2).
• Complete the final moisture incorporation pass ensuring the stabiliser cuts into the
adjoining stabilised materials thus forming a sufficient overlap (refer to Step 3 in
Figure 8.6.12.2)."
MRTS07B,8.6.12.3,Transverse joints,25,25,"For transverse joints that are not fresh, the adjoining stabilised section shall be mixed using a
stabiliser by the greater of 1.5 m or the length ordered by the Administrator.
Where there is more than one layer of insitu stabilised material, the transverse joints of each layer
shall be offset from the underlying layer’s joint by a minimum distance of 150 mm."
MRTS07B,8.6.13,Surface finish,25,26,"The finished surface of any stabilised pavement layer shall:
• be hard and homogenous in appearance
• not be friable when subject to mechanical brooming
• not have transverse shrinkage cracks
• not have any loose, segregated or contaminated areas
• have the course particles slightly exposed
• not be affected by delamination
• not have any cracking
• not show signs of water pumping, and
• not visibly deflect under load when proof rolled in accordance with Clause 9.8.
For layers that are to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment, the surface shall have a
maximum ball penetration value that complies with Clause 8.7.6.
It is intended that these requirements apply to the condition of the pavement surface immediately
prior to application of the surfacing treatment / layer. The Contractor may need to undertake
additional controls beyond the basic construction activities (compaction, trimming and so on) to
ensure these requirements are satisfied.
Where a stabilised pavement layer is required to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment,
particular attention needs to be given to the surface finish of the stabilised pavement layer in order
to ensure good adhesion. This is particularly relevant when the treatment includes polymer
modified bitumen.
The following factors are important to ensure the successful adhesion of a sprayed bituminous
treatment:
• All dust must be removed from the pavement immediately before spraying
• Compaction of the stabilised pavement layer may form a thin lens of dried slurry on the
surface of the pavement. This can appear hard, however may be prone to ‘shattering’ or
delamination and should be removed before spraying
• Variation in the surface ‘tightness’ may warrant the specification of either an AMC0 or
AMC00 prime (or an equivalent emulsion prime accepted by the Administrator). The
effectiveness of any prime should be assessed in field trials.
Inadequate curing can lead to an excessively dusty surface, which may be difficult to prepare. To
address this, curing should be undertaken in accordance with Clause 8.6.14 to ensure the
pavement remains continuously damp.
Where the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with another pavement layer (that is, not bitumen
seal and/or asphalt), consideration needs to be given on how to adequately prepare the surface to
maximise the bond between the pavement layers.
If the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with another insitu stabilised layer, it is recommended
that the overlying layer be insitu stabilised to a depth which will 'tuck in' to the underlying layer. The
‘tuck in’ details shall be provided in the Contract documents.
If the insitu stabilised layer is to be overlaid with a plant-mixed stabilised or granular layer, it is
recommended that the finished surface be hard-cut and/or broomed to produce a roughly textured
surface before placing the next layer."
MRTS07B,8.6.14,Curing,26,27,"A curing operation shall commence immediately after the completion of compaction. Curing operation
shall be carried out with extreme care to avoid any damage to the stabilised layer.
The stabilised layer shall be cured using water by maintaining the layer surface and edges in a
continuously damp condition, using a uniformly applied fine mist, until the stabilised layer is covered
by an overlying pavement layer or a sprayed bituminous surfacing with cover aggregate is placed as
described in Clause 8.6.16 has been applied.
Water shall be applied in a manner such that slurrying of the surface, pavement instability and erosion
and/or leaching of the stabilising agent are all avoided. During the water curing process, no heavy
construction equipment shall be allowed on the stabilised layer."
MRTS07B,8.6.15,Maintenance of the stabilised layer,27,27,"The stabilised layer shall be maintained by the Contractor until a bituminous surfacing with a cover
aggregate is applied, or until the stabilised layer is covered by another pavement layer, or until the
Administrator accepts and takes responsibility for that area (whichever is the longer).
The surface of the stabilised layer shall be kept moist, in good order, in good condition and free from
contamination. Construction and other traffic shall not traverse the stabilised layer where damage to
the surface may occur.
No separate or additional payment shall be made for maintenance of the stabilised layer. The cost of
all activities associated with maintenance of the stabilised layer shall be deemed to be incorporated
into the relevant work items for the stabilised layer."

be applied within seven calendar days of completion of the stabilised layer."

When compacting an insitu stabilised layer thickness of 200 – 300 mm a padfoot roller is required
for initial compaction. After the removal of padfoot marks (refer to Clause 8.6.11), care needs to be
taken by the Contractor to ensure that the final smooth drum rolling does not de-compact (or crack)
the stabilised layer.
Typically, insitu stabilised layer thicknesses are not less than 200 mm. However, for layer thickness
< 200 mm, the Contractor shall use a combination of smooth drum and multi-tyre rollers which has
demonstrated it will achieve the specified relative compaction. After the removal of the stabiliser's
tyre tread marks (refer to Clause 8.6.11), care needs to be taken by the Contractor to ensure that
the final smooth drum rolling does not de-compact (or crack) the stabilised layer."

of the depth checks shall be stated in Clause 5.4. Depth checks shall be undertaken by a Surveyor in
accordance with the limits of accuracy defined in MRTS56 Construction Surveying.
Following compaction and final trim, levels shall be obtained from the top of the finished stabilised

compaction results. The characteristic value shall be calculated as stated in Clause 12 of
MRTS01 Introduction to Technical Specifications or Test Method Q020 using the individual relative
compaction results determined from testing each lot.
Where the minimum characteristic value of a lot’s compaction results does not comply with the
requirements of this specification, the Contractor shall raise a suitable non-conformance report. The
Administrator should review each individual compaction result. The review may necessitate the
need for additional investigation to identify the underlying cause(s) for the noncompliance. The
Administrator should also review the homogeneity of the works.
The locations of all tests undertaken for the determination of insitu dry density and relative compaction
shall be at the same locations of samples taken to determine the corresponding laboratory MDR.
Sampling of stabilised materials to determine the laboratory MDR as detailed in Test Method Q142A
shall take place immediately after the final moisture incorporation pass, and prior to the
commencement of compaction of the stabilised material.
The relative compaction of the stabilised material as detailed in Test Method Q140A shall be
determined for the entire thickness of the stabilised layer.
Inherently, the insitu stabilisation process involves the mixing of existing materials whose properties
can be unpredictable and may also vary within the Project limits. Therefore, caution must be
applied when seeking to determine nuclear gauge biases (refer to Nuclear Gauge Testing Manual
(NGTM) Test Method N01), and/or, attempting to establish and monitor assigned values (refer to
Test Method Q144A)."

Method Q250.
The moisture sample locations shall be identical to the MDR sampling locations for compaction testing
(refer to Clause 9.6). The moisture samples shall be extracted immediately after the final moisture
incorporation pass by the stabiliser and prior to the addition of any additional moisture for the
purposes of compaction and trimming.
Following sampling, oven drying of all specimens used to determine the moisture content shall
commence within the same work shift as the stabilisation works for the corresponding lot.
The moisture ratio shall be calculated using the individual moisture content compared to the optimum
moisture content for each corresponding location (refer to Clause 9.6). As a minimum frequency, the
moisture ratio of the uncompacted materials shall be assessed at each test location for compaction.
The results shall be reported to the Administrator as soon as it is available."

MRTS07B,9.8.2,Proof rolling of stabilised layers,37,38,"The proof rolling test specified in this clause shall apply to a completed stabilised layer, unless stated
otherwise in Clause 8 of Annexure MRTS07B.1. If no indication is given, the proof rolling test shall
apply.
Each stabilised layer shall be tested for perceptible surface deformation by ‘proof rolling’ the stabilised
layer, in the presence of the Administrator Witness Point 7. All areas of the stabilised layers shall be
‘proof rolled’, including all trafficked lanes, shoulders and other areas.
Testing shall be in accordance with Test Method Q723 unless otherwise approved by the
Administrator. Testing for perceptible surface deformation is exempt from the requirement for NATA
accreditation or Construction Material Testing (CMT) registration.
Where the surface of any section of a stabilised layer displays perceptible surface deformation under
proof rolling, the Administrator may require the Contractor to undertake additional compliance testing
to ensure that the affected section of the stabilised layer complies with Clauses 8.7.3, 8.7.4 and 8.7.5.
No additional payment shall be made by the Principal for such additional testing.
Where the surface of any section of a stabilised layer displays perceptible surface deformation under
proof rolling, the construction of any overlying pavement layer and/or spray seal shall not proceed until
the Administrator grants the Contractor permission to proceed in accordance with Clause 9.10.
The proof rolling result reported for any stabilised layer lot shall be representative of the condition of
the lot immediately prior to it being covered by another pavement layer or spray seal. If the stabilised
layer lot has been subjected to rainfall or moisture ingress in any way since proof rolling was
undertaken, the Administrator may direct the Contractor to retest the lot to prove conformance. If the
retested results do not comply with the requirements of this Technical Specification, the Contractor
shall rectify the stabilised layer such that it complies with the requirements of this Technical
Specification. No additional payment will be made by the Principal for any such additional efforts.
Test Method Q723 provides a method for using a loaded water tanker for proof rolling."
MRTS07B,9.9,Ball penetration testing,38,38,"For stabilised pavement layers that are to be covered by a sprayed bituminous treatment, the
Contractor shall undertake ball penetration testing on the completed layer prior to undertaking the
sprayed bituminous treatment.
Minimum testing frequencies for ball penetration testing shall be as specified in Clause 5.4.
In accordance with AG:PT/T251, ball penetration results shall be reported as both individual and
average values.
For the average value to be adopted for lot conformance and seal design purposes, the results
must be representative of a homogeneous section of pavement. Any areas represented by
excessively low or high individual values should be considered for sub-lotting, and may require
additional construction or testing actions before they can be incorporated into the final works. Any
such works shall be undertaken by the Contractor at no cost to the Principal.
The ball penetration result reported for any stabilised layer lot shall be representative of the condition
of the lot immediately prior to it being covered. If the stabilised layer lot has been subjected to rainfall
or moisture ingress in any way since ball penetration testing was undertaken, the Administrator may
direct the Contractor to retest the lot to prove conformance. If the retested results do not comply with
the requirements of this Technical Specification, the Contractor shall rectify the stabilised layer such
that it complies with the requirements of this Technical Specification. No additional payment will be
made by the Principal for any such additional efforts."
