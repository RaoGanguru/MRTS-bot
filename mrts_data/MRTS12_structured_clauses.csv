aggregate being partly interlocked.
Every attempt shall be made to achieve the required spread pattern on the first spreading pass. Bare
or insufficiently covered areas shall be re-treated as soon as possible with a further light spreading run
or by hand spreading. Overspreading or underspreading of the aggregate shall be avoided.
If there is an uneven distribution of cover aggregate, it shall be drag broomed until it is evenly
distributed without dislodgment of any embedded cover aggregate.
Cover aggregate shall be spread so that the amount of material spread is not less than that
represented by the Design Spread Rate or greater than 5% above that represented by the Design
Spread Rate. Any initial underspreading shall be rectified as specified above.

Where the work is being carried out under traffic, the speed of traffic shall be adequately controlled
until the work is swept."
MRTS12,14.7,Two applications of cover aggregate with a single application of binder,15,15,"The intent of this work is to slightly reduce the amount of material spread on the first coat of cover
aggregate to accommodate the second, smaller aggregate coat.
The following exceptions to the previous procedures for the spreading of cover aggregate shall apply
to this work:
a) the first application of cover aggregate shall be spread so that small gaps are left. This may
require a 5% to 10% reduction to the normal amount of material spread
